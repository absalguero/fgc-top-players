        We collect the categories of information described below to operate, secure, and improve the Site and to communicate with you.
        We do not collect sensitive personal information.
      </p>

      <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>

      <h3>Information We Collect Automatically (Log Data)</h3>
      <p>
        When you visit the Site, we (and our service providers) may automatically collect device and usage information ("Log Data"),
        such as IP address (which may be truncated or anonymized), browser type/version, device identifiers, pages viewed,

    </div>
    <div class="home-card__content policy-card__content">
      <p>
        The Site publishes rankings, statistics, tournament results, and biographical information about competitive fighting game players. This information is
        collected from publicly available sources, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public tournament brackets and results (e.g., start.gg, Challonge, smash.gg)</li>
        <li>Official tournament organizer announcements and press releases</li>
        <li>Publicly available player social media profiles and bios</li>
        <li>Live-streamed tournament broadcasts and commentary</li>
        <li>Community-maintained wikis and databases</li>
        <li>Player-disclosed information from interviews and public statements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Player rankings, tournament placements, and performance metrics published on the Site are derived from
        publicly reported tournament results and are not "personal information" collected directly from you as a Site visitor. This information is
        publicly accessible and is used for the legitimate purpose of providing competitive gaming rankings and analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a player featured on the Site and wish to correct inaccurate biographical information (such as name spelling, country, character selection, or
        social media links), please contact us at <a href="mailto:fgcpr@gmail.com">fgcpr@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we are committed to correcting demonstrable errors in biographical data, we do not alter or remove factual tournament results or historical rankings, as they constitute a public record of competitive events.
