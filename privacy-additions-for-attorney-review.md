**IMPORTANT: These are DRAFT provisions for attorney review. Do NOT publish without review by licensed legal counsel.**

---

## Current Privacy Policy Status

**Strengths:**

- ✅ No sale/sharing disclosure
- ✅ GPC signal compliance

**Gaps Identified:**
- ❌ No data retention periods
- ❌ Missing detailed user rights (GDPR, CCPA)
- ❌ No public information disclosure (player rankings are PUBLIC data)
- ❌ No specific analytics service disclosure
- ❌ No international data transfer notice
- ❌ Missing California-specific rights
- ❌ No publicly available information use policy
- ❌ Change notification inconsistent with proposed Terms update

## Addition 1: Enhanced Children's Privacy (Update Section 7)

### Suggested: Replace existing Section 7 entirely

```html
<div class="profile-card mb-md">
  <div class="profile-card__header">
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="home-card__content policy-card__content">
    <p>
      The Site is not intended for or directed to children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent as required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are between 13 and 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), you may only use the Site with the permission and supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by our <a href="/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided personal information to us without your consent, or if you are aware of a minor using the Site without proper parental permission, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:fgcpr@gmail.com">fgcpr@gmail.com</a>. We will promptly investigate and delete such information from our systems.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Addition 2: Publicly Available Information (New Section - Insert after Section 1)

### Suggested Placement: New Section 1A

```html
<div class="profile-card mb-md">
  <div class="profile-card__header">
    <h2>1A. Use of Publicly Available Information</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="home-card__content policy-card__content">
    <p>
      The Site publishes rankings, statistics, tournament results, and biographical information about professional and competitive fighting game players. This information is collected from publicly available sources, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Public tournament brackets and results (e.g., start.gg, Challonge, smash.gg)</li>
      <li>Official tournament organizer announcements and press releases</li>
      <li>Publicly available player social media profiles and bios</li>
      <li>Live-streamed tournament broadcasts and commentary</li>
      <li>Community-maintained wikis and databases</li>
      <li>Player-disclosed information from interviews and public statements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Player rankings, statistics, tournament placements, and performance metrics published on the Site are derived from publicly reported tournament results and are not "personal information" collected directly from you as a Site visitor. This information is publicly accessible and is used for the legitimate purpose of providing competitive gaming rankings and analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a player featured on the Site and wish to correct inaccurate biographical information (such as name spelling, country, character selection, or social media links), please contact us at <a href="mailto:fgcpr@gmail.com">fgcpr@gmail.com</a> or via our <a href="/contact/">contact form</a>. We do not remove tournament results or historical rankings, as they represent factual public record, but we will correct demonstrable errors in biographical data.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Addition 3: Third-Party Services and Analytics (Expand Section 2)

### Suggested: Add new subsection to Section 2

```html
<h3>Third-Party Analytics and Services</h3>
<p>
  We use third-party service providers to help us understand how visitors use the Site and to improve Site performance. These services may collect information about your use of the Site through cookies and similar technologies. Third-party services we may use include:

  <li><strong>Hosting Providers</strong> - To store and serve Site data</li>
  <li><strong>Email Service Providers</strong> - To manage contact form submissions and communications (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These third parties may have their own privacy policies and are subject to their own data collection practices. We do not control their privacy practices and encourage you to review their policies.
</p>
<p>
  To opt out of Google Analytics tracking, you may install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.

<div class="profile-card mb-md">
  <div class="profile-card__header">

    </p>
    <p>
      Note that publicly available information about players (tournament results, rankings, statistics) is retained as historical record and is not subject to deletion requests, except as required by applicable law.
