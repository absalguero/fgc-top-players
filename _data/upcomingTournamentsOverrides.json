    "description": "<p>Frosty Faustings XVIII 2026 is the 18th annual edition of the Midwest’s largest fighting game festival. Held at the Westin Chicago Lombard, this four-day event is celebrated for its massive variety of tournaments, 24-hour venue access, and unique 'convention-style' atmosphere. While historically known as a haven for anime fighters, the event has evolved into a global major for all fighting game disciplines, including Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, and the highly anticipated 2XKO.</p><p>The 2026 event distinguishes itself with one of the most diverse lineups in the FGC, running nearly 30 main stage games. A major headline for 2026 is the official partnership with Riot Games for 2XKO, featuring a special mixed-mode tournament with a $50,000 prize pool. For Street Fighter 6 players, the event offers a massive singles bracket and the unique Sunday Special 2v2 Waseda-style Team Tournament, a format that emphasizes team strategy.</p><p>Unlike many esports majors, the venue remains open 24 hours a day from Thursday to Sunday, allowing for non-stop casual matches and community events like the famous late-night Karaoke and Artist Alley. The Westin Chicago Lombard is located approximately 25 minutes from O'Hare International Airport, with registration available via Start.gg.</p>",
