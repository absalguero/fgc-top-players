        <p style="text-align:left; font-size:1.1em; margin-bottom:2rem;">
          Welcome to the official guide to our proprietary analytics. This glossary explains the key metrics we use to evaluate player and character performance in the competitive scene. You’ll find quick definitions, links to examples, and related pages like the <a href="/fgpi/">Fighting Game Performance Index (FGPI)</a>, <a href="/player-stats/">Player Stats</a>, and <a href="/character-stats/">Character Stats &amp; CPV</a>.
        </p>

        <section id="player-metrics">
          <h2>Player-Specific Metrics</h2>
          <p>These stats provide a nuanced view of an individual competitor's skill and competitive form over the last 12 months.</p>

          <h3 id="fgpi"><i class="fas fa-gauge-high"></i> Fighting Game Performance Index (FGPI)</h3>
          <p><strong>FGPI</strong> is a comprehensive rating of a player's overall performance, analyzing results over the past 12 months. It blends recent form, consistency, competition strength, and event context for a holistic view. <a href="/fgpi/">Learn more about FGPI</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="ms"><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Momentum Score (MS)</h3>
          <p><strong>MS</strong> measures a player's current performance trend by comparing recent results against their established baseline—useful for spotting who’s heating up.</p>

          <h3 id="pf"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Performance Floor (PF)</h3>
          <p><strong>PF</strong> gauges consistency by focusing on lowest placement percentiles. A high PF belongs to a player who rarely suffers early exits.</p>

          <h3 id="app"><i class="fas fa-percent"></i> Average Placement Percentile (APP)</h3>
          <p><strong>APP</strong> measures a player's typical finish relative to field size. For example, 95% means finishing better than 95% of the bracket on average.</p>

          <h3 id="apm"><i class="fas fa-crown"></i> Avg. Percentile at Majors (APM)</h3>
          <p><strong>APM</strong> isolates performance at premier-level events, highlighting how well a player performs when stakes and field strength are highest.</p>

          <h3 id="tdr"><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Tournament Difficulty Rating (TDR)</h3>
          <p><strong>TDR</strong> assesses the strength of a player's schedule based on event tier and opponent quality, adding crucial context to raw results.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="character-metrics">
          <h2>Character-Specific Metrics</h2>
          <p>These stats analyze the viability and performance of a character within the competitive ecosystem.</p>

          <h3 id="cpv"><i class="fas fa-gauge-high"></i> Competitive Performance Viability (CPV)</h3>
          <p><strong>CPV</strong> is the headline measure of a character's competitive strength. This proprietary score synthesizes tournament results, representation by top players, and consistency into a single number.</p>

          <h3 id="cms"><i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Character Momentum Score (CMS)</h3>
          <p><strong>CMS</strong> tracks a character's recent trajectory, comparing current performance to historical baseline to identify rising or cooling trends.</p>

          <h3 id="cpf"><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Character Performance Floor (CPF)</h3>
          <p><strong>CPF</strong> measures a character's baseline consistency via lowest placement percentiles, indicating reliability even in tough brackets or matchups.</p>

          <h3 id="t3r"><i class="fas fa-medal"></i> Top-3 Rate (T3R)</h3>
          <p><strong>T3R</strong> quantifies how frequently a character secures 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. It’s the share of rated tournament appearances across the last 12 months resulting in those finishes, with optional weighting by event tier and field size. A higher T3R indicates reliable conversion of deep runs into medal-range outcomes.</p>

          <h3 id="ts"><i class="fas fa-chart-area"></i> Tournament Specialization (TS)</h3>
          <p><strong>TS</strong> evaluates how a character’s strengths play at premier events, often revealing high ceilings or specialized tools that shine in elite brackets.</p>

          <h3 id="tp"><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i> Tournament Popularity (TP)</h3>
          <p><strong>TP</strong> measures how widely a character is used successfully. Scored on a 0–100 scale, higher TP indicates tournament success distributed across many players, signaling broad accessibility.</p>

          <h3 id="rdi"><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> Regional Dominance Index (RDI)</h3>
          <p><strong>RDI</strong> identifies a character’s peak performance in its strongest competitive region, surfacing regional meta differences and strengths.</p>
