                    <p>
                        Our FGC ranking system provides an accurate and current reflection of player skill and performance specifically for Street Fighter 6 (SF6). It ranks players based on their top results from sanctioned offline tournaments worldwide, rewarding consistent excellence and recent achievements. You can view the <a href="/">current player rankings here</a>.

                <section id="how-ranking-works">
                    <h2>How the Ranking System Works</h2>
                    <p>Our system is designed to fairly evaluate player performance by focusing on meaningful <a href="/tournament-results/">tournament results</a> and ongoing competitive form.</p>

                    <h3 id="results-scoring"><i class="fas fa-medal"></i> Results-Based Scoring</h3>
                    <p>Players earn points according to their final placing at offline tournaments. Higher placings receive significantly more points, ensuring that top finishes have the greatest impact on rankings.</p>

                    <h3 id="best-performances"><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i> Best Performances</h3>
                    <p>To balance quantity and quality, only each player’s five highest-rated performances are included in their overall ranking. This approach rewards consistent top-level play without favoring players who simply attend a large number of events. <a href="#faq-fewer-events" onclick="document.getElementById('faq-fewer-events').open = true;">(How does attendance affect rank?)</a></p>

                    <h3 id="event-valuation"><i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i> Event Weighting</h3>
                    <p>Each tournament's value is dynamically calculated based on multiple factors, including the prestige and history of the tournament, the strength of competition, and the prize money offered. Larger, more prestigious tournaments with stronger player fields and higher stakes carry greater weight in the ranking system.</p>

                    <h3 id="recency-bias"><i class="fas fa-history"></i> Recency Bias</h3>
                    <p>The system emphasizes recent <a href="/tournament-results/">tournament results</a> to ensure the rankings accurately represent who is performing best right now. Older results gradually have less influence, keeping the leaderboard fresh and relevant.</p>

                    <h3 id="offline-events"><i class="fas fa-users"></i> In-Person Events Only</h3>
                    <p>Rankings are based exclusively on sanctioned offline tournaments. Sanctioned tournaments are offline events that meet specific standards for fairness and competitive integrity. <a href="#faq-online-events" onclick="document.getElementById('faq-online-events').open = true;">(Why not online events?)</a></p>

                    <h3 id="data-sources"><i class="fas fa-clipboard-check"></i> Data Sources &amp; Verification</h3>
                    <p>We prioritize accurate and reliable data collection from trusted tournament organizers and verified results to maintain the integrity of the rankings. Our commitment ensures that player standings reflect genuine competitive performance.</p>

                    <h3 id="global-recognition"><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> Global Recognition</h3>
                    <p>Our ranking system recognizes offline fighting game tournaments from around the world, promoting a diverse and comprehensive competitive landscape. Tournament organizers interested in having their events evaluated are encouraged to contact us. <a href="#faq-inclusion" onclick="document.getElementById('faq-inclusion').open = true;">(How do I get a tournament included?)</a></p>

                    <h3 id="updates-transparency"><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Regular Updates & Transparency</h3>
                    <p>Rankings are updated regularly to incorporate the latest <a href="/tournament-results/">tournament results</a>. Developed by and for the fighting game community, our ranking algorithms and weighting factors are designed to fairly recognize performance, consistency, and current competitive form. <a href="#faq-updates" onclick="document.getElementById('faq-updates').open = true;">(How often are rankings updated?)</a></p>

                    <h2>Putting It All Together: A Player's Journey</h2>
                    <p>Let's illustrate how the system works with a hypothetical player, "Player X":</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Event 1 (Premier Tier):</strong> Player X places 3rd, earning 800 rating points.</li>
                        <li><strong>Event 2 (Major Tier):</strong> Player X places 1st, earning 650 rating points.</li>
                        <li><strong>Event 3 (A Regional Event - Standard Tier):</strong> Player X places 1st, earning 300 rating points.</li>
                        <li><strong>Event 4 (Last Year's Premier):</strong> Player X placed 5th. This result is now a year old, so its value decays and no longer earns full rating points.</li>
                        <li><strong>Event 5 & 6 (Two other events):</strong> Player X also placed well in two other events, earning 400 and 350 ratings points respectively.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The system takes Player X's <strong>top five</strong> performances, factoring in recency. Their total score would be calculated from the results of Event 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, while the decayed result from Event 4 would be dropped in favor of a more recent, higher-scoring performance. This ensures the ranking reflects their current form.</p>

                        <summary>How are player rankings calculated?</summary>

                        <summary>How do these rankings differ from a game's built-in online ladder or ranked mode?</summary>
                        <p>Our rankings and a game's internal online ladder are both valuable, but they measure different aspects of competitive skill. Our system is based exclusively on performance in high-stakes, <strong>offline tournaments</strong>, which test a player's ability under the pressure of a live event. The in-game ranked mode is an excellent measure of a player's <strong>online consistency</strong> over a high volume of matches. We see them as complementary: the in-game ladder shows who excels in the day-to-day online environment, while our system focuses on identifying the world's best tournament performers.</p>
