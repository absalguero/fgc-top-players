          <h2>Overview: Accurate & Current Player Rankings for Street Fighter 6</h2>
          <p>
            Our SF6 player ranking system reflects live competitive form using results scoring, event weighting, and recency from sanctioned offline tournaments.
            See the <a href="/street-fighter-6-rankings/">current rankings</a>, browse <a href="/tournament-results/">recent tournament results</a>, or explore metrics on the
            <a href="/player-stats/">Player Stats Leaderboard</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="how-ranking-works">
          <h2>How the Ranking System Works</h2>
          <p>Our system is designed to evaluate player performance by focusing on meaningful <a href="/tournament-results/">tournament results</a> and current competitive form.</p>

          <h3 id="results-scoring"><i class="fas fa-medal"></i> Results-Based Scoring</h3>
          <p>Players earn rating points according to final placing at offline tournaments. Higher placings receive more points, ensuring that top finishes have the greatest impact on rankings.</p>

          <h3 id="best-performances"><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i> Best Performances</h3>
          <p>To balance quantity and quality, only each player’s five highest-rated performances are included in their overall ranking. This rewards consistent top-level play without favoring sheer attendance. <a href="#faq-fewer-events" onclick="document.getElementById('faq-fewer-events').open = true;">(How does attendance affect rank?)</a></p>

          <h3 id="event-valuation"><i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i> Event Weighting</h3>
          <p>Each tournament’s value is calculated using multiple factors, including event prestige/history, strength of competition, and prize pool. Larger, more prestigious events with stronger fields carry greater weight.</p>

          <h3 id="recency-bias"><i class="fas fa-history"></i> Recency Bias</h3>
          <p>The system emphasizes recent <a href="/tournament-results/">tournament results</a> so the leaderboard represents who is performing best right now. Older results gradually have less influence.</p>

          <h3 id="offline-events"><i class="fas fa-users"></i> In-Person Events Only</h3>
          <p>
            Rankings are based exclusively on sanctioned offline tournaments.
            Sanctioned tournaments are offline events approved by official organizers and run under an established ruleset.
            <a href="#faq-online-events" onclick="document.getElementById('faq-online-events').open = true;">(Why not online events?)</a>
          </p>

          <h3 id="data-sources"><i class="fas fa-clipboard-check"></i> Data Sources & Verification</h3>
          <p>We prioritize accurate data collection from trusted organizers and verified results to maintain ranking integrity. Our process ensures that standings reflect genuine competitive performance.</p>

          <h3 id="global-recognition"><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> Global Recognition</h3>
          <p>Our ranking system recognizes offline fighting game tournaments worldwide, promoting a diverse and comprehensive competitive landscape. Organizers can request event evaluation. <a href="#faq-inclusion" onclick="document.getElementById('faq-inclusion').open = true;">(How do I get a tournament included?)</a></p>

          <h3 id="updates-transparency"><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Regular Updates & Transparency</h3>
          <p>Rankings are updated regularly to incorporate the latest <a href="/tournament-results/">tournament results</a>. Built by and for the FGC, our approach aims to recognize performance, consistency, and current form. <a href="#faq-updates" onclick="document.getElementById('faq-updates').open = true;">(How often are rankings updated?)</a></p>

        <section id="example-calculation">
          <h2>Putting It All Together: A Player's Journey</h2>
          <p>Here's a simplified example illustrating how results, event weight, and recency interact:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Event 1 (Premier Tier):</strong> Player places 3rd — high points due to placing and tier.</li>
            <li><strong>Event 2 (Major Tier):</strong> Player places 1st — strong points; recent win boosts impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Event 3 (Regional/Standard):</strong> Player places 1st — solid points; lower event weight than Premier/Major.</li>
            <li><strong>Event 4 (Old Premier):</strong> Player placed 5th last year — value decays with time.</li>
            <li><strong>Event 5 & 6:</strong> Additional solid finishes — recency/weight determine which five results count.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The system keeps the <strong>top five</strong> weighted results with recency applied, ensuring the ranking reflects current form.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
          <details>
            <summary>How are player rankings calculated?</summary>

            <p>Our rankings and in-game ladders measure different things. We evaluate performance in high-stakes <strong>offline tournaments</strong>, while ranked ladders reflect <strong>online consistency</strong> over many matches. Together they offer a fuller picture of competitive level.</p>

            <summary>Can a player’s ranking change if they attend fewer events?</summary>
