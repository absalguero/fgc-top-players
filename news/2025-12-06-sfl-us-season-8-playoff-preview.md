The regular season of **Street Fighter League (SFL) Pro-US Season 8** has come to a close, and the hierarchy is clear. **Bandits** has finished at the summit of the table, capping off a dominant run with a **370-point** finish.

However, the real season begins tomorrow, **Sunday, December 7**, when the top four teams clash in the playoffs. With the bracket officially set, we look at the contenders hoping to dethrone the kings and the heartbreaking exits that defined the final week.

## The Playoff Field

The race for the top four came down to the wire in Burbank. Here is how the survivors stack up heading into Sunday's championship bracket.

### 1. Bandits (11-1, 370 pts)
**The Final Boss**
Bandits has operated with military precision throughout Season 8. Finishing with an imposing **11-1 record** and a massive +30 game differential, the squad led by **MenaRD**, **Caba**, **Chris T**, and **Booce** has looked nearly untouchable. By securing the first seed, they bypass the initial chaos of the lower bracket and wait in the Grand Finals. They are the heavy favorites to represent the US at the World Championship.

### 2. 2Game Esports (7-5, 300 pts)
**The South American Coalition**
Defying expectations, **2Game Esports** proved they are a legitimate super-team. The squad featuring **Blaz**, **Shaka**, **Juninho-RAS**, and **Brayan Job** utilized a high-damage playstyle to disrupt the league's hierarchy. Finishing with a solid 300 points, they secured the second seed, giving them a significant tactical advantage in the bracket.

### 3. KuaiShou Gaming (7-5, 270 pts)
**The Sleeping Giant**
After a mixed start, the Chinese powerhouse **KuaiShou Gaming** (KSG) found their form just in time. **Xiaohai**, **Vxbao**, **Zhen**, and **Micky** delivered clutch performances to salvage their season. While they tied 2Game in match record, they finished 30 points behind in score, landing them in the third seed. They remain a dangerous opponent capable of beating anyone in a long set.

### 4. FlyQuest (6-6, 240 pts)
**Punk's Last Stand**
It was a close call, but **FlyQuest** secured the final playoff spot. Finishing at .500 with a 6-6 record, **Punk**, **Nephew**, **Psycho**, and **Riddles** managed to hold off the chasing pack. They enter Sunday as the underdogs, needing to run the entire gauntlet to win the title.

## The Heartbreak: Shopify Rebellion

The most shocking result of the week was the elimination of **Shopify Rebellion**. Despite high expectations, they finished 5th with a **5-7 record** and **210 points**, missing the postseason.

The narrative of their season was a struggle to find consistent output across the roster. **Dual Kevin** struggled to find his rhythm, ending the season with a **4-8 record**. This was a surprising downturn given his standing in the **[Top 5 globally](/street-fighter-6-rankings/)**. Without a dominant anchor performance to steady the ship, and with **NuckleDu** managing a respectable but insufficient 7-5 record, the team simply could not close the 30-point gap needed to catch FlyQuest.

## How to Watch

The **Street Fighter League US Season 8 Playoffs** take place tomorrow, **Sunday, December 7**. You can catch all the action live on the official Capcom Fighters channels.
