## The Veteran Joins the Ninjas

Ninjas in Pyjamas has secured one of Japan's most charismatic and versatile fighting game players. Known for his strong T. Hawk in *Super Street Fighter IV* and more recently his diverse play across modern titles, KojiKOG brings over 15 years of competitive experience to the Swedish organization. This move marks another significant investment by NIP into the Fighting Game Community (FGC), continuing the expansion they began in 2024.

The announcement comes off the back of a strong 2025 season for KojiKOG. He garnered international attention at EVO 2025 in Las Vegas, where he placed 5th in the *Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves* bracket. His emotional reaction to a loss during the Top 8 became one of the event's most viral moments, endearing him to fans worldwide. Beyond the memes, his performance solidified him as a top contender in SNK's latest title while he continues to compete at a high level in *Street Fighter 6*.

With the Capcom Cup 12 qualifiers and the *Fatal Fury* competitive season on the horizon, NIP is positioning itself as a multi-game threat. KojiKOG's addition provides the team with a dedicated Japanese representative, bridging the gap between the European and Asian competitive scenes.

## What’s Next

KojiKOG is expected to represent Ninjas in Pyjamas immediately in upcoming regional qualifiers. All eyes will be on his performance in the remainder of the *Street Fighter 6* season as he attempts to secure a spot at Capcom Cup 12. Additionally, with *Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves* firmly established as a premier esports title, KojiKOG's early mastery of the game makes him a contender for upcoming SNK World Championship events.
