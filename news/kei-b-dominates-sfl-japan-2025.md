In a season defined by fierce competition and shifting metas, Kei "KEI.B" Komada has emerged as the undisputed MVP of the Street Fighter League (SFL) Pro-Japan 2025. Concluding the regular season on November 25, KEI.B secured the title of top points earner, accumulating a staggering 140 points for his team, Nagoya OJA NTP.

His performance has not only solidified his status as a premier *Street Fighter 6* competitor but also propelled Nagoya OJA, a team many considered underdogs, into a prime playoff position.

## A Historic Statistical Masterclass

The numbers behind KEI.B’s season are nothing short of historic. In a league where breaking the 100-point threshold is the benchmark for an elite season, KEI.B shattered expectations by reaching 140 points, finishing a full 20 points ahead of the league's other top performers like Adelie, Sahara., and Fuudo, who all concluded with 120.

His consistency was the engine behind Nagoya OJA NTP’s success. With the team finishing the season with 260 total points, KEI.B was responsible for over 53% of his squad's entire offensive output. This level of individual contribution is a statistical anomaly in a team format that typically relies on balanced scoring across four players.

Even more remarkable was his win rate. Competing in the high-stakes Division S, KEI.B finished the regular season with a near-perfect record, dropping only a single game to the reigning champion, Gachikun of Good 8 Squad.

This dominance is particularly notable given his global standing entering the league. Currently ranked 222nd in the world by FGC Top Players, KEI.B played far above his statistical projection, dismantling higher-ranked veterans and proving that his current form is significantly higher than his ranking suggests.

## The Mai Shiranui Factor

A key component of KEI.B’s dominance was his character choice. Piloting Mai Shiranui, KEI.B showcased an unparalleled mastery of the fighter’s toolkit.

With Mai Shiranui firmly established as one of the top characters in the current meta, KEI.B demonstrated exactly why she is so feared at the highest level of play. Rather than relying solely on the character's inherent strength, he displayed superior execution and spacing that set him apart from other Mai users. His ability to maximize her lethal punish game allowed him to dismantle opponents like Bonchan, kobayan, and moke, turning the character's top-tier potential into guaranteed points for his team.

## From DBFZ to SF6 Stardom

Longtime fighting game fans recognize KEI.B (formerly known as BNBBN) for his accomplishments in *Dragon Ball FighterZ*, where he was a World Tour finalist. His transition to *Street Fighter 6* has been seamless, culminating in this breakout season.

This performance in SFL Japan 2025 marks his complete evolution into a top-tier Street Fighter competitor. By outperforming legendary veterans and securing the highest individual score in the league, KEI.B has silenced any doubts about his versatility across fighting game titles.

## Playoff Implications for Nagoya OJA NTP

Thanks to KEI.B’s heroics, Nagoya OJA NTP has defied preseason predictions to finish second in Division S. They now advance to the playoffs with significant momentum.

Their seeding grants them a favorable position where they will face Crazy Raccoon in the first round of the playoffs, starting from the "home" position. A victory there would set up a highly anticipated rematch against the division leaders, Good 8 Squad, in the Grand Final.

With the playoffs scheduled for December, all eyes will be on KEI.B. If he can maintain the form that earned him 140 points and a near-perfect record, Nagoya OJA NTP stands a very real chance of claiming the SFL Japan championship.
