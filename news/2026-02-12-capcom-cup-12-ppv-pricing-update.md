## Community Victory: Capcom Responds to Feedback

Less than a month before the event kicks off at the Ryogoku Kokugikan, Capcom has pivoted on its controversial decision to paywall the Capcom Cup 12 Finals. Originally announced at the Tokyo Game Show in late 2025, the initial plan to charge approximately $27-$40 for the broadcast sparked widespread outrage across the Fighting Game Community, with many questioning the accessibility of the season's premier event.

The official Capcom Fighters social channels released a statement confirming the restructuring of the ticket model. The new approach aims to balance the high production costs of the Tokyo venue with the community's expectation of accessibility.

> **"Following the announcement that live viewing for this event would be ticketed, we carefully reviewed the many opinions and feedback we received from the community. After thorough discussions across various departments within Capcom, we have decided... to revise the pricing of live viewing tickets [and] to implement special collaborative initiatives in Street Fighter 6."**

## Revised Pricing & Viewing Options

The updated model introduces a tiered system that allows hardcore fans to support the stream while ensuring casual viewers are not locked out. The paid "Premium" stream, which likely features higher bitrates or exclusive camera angles, has been reduced to a fraction of the original cost.

More importantly for the general player base, Capcom confirmed that the **Battle Hub** will serve as a free "public viewing" venue. Players can log into *Street Fighter 6* during the finals to watch the matches on the giant in-game monitor without purchasing a ticket.

<div class="table-wrapper m-auto max-w-90ch" style="margin-bottom: 40px; overflow-x: auto;">
  <table class="data-table" style="min-width: 100%;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Ticket Type</th>
        <th>Price (Approx. USD)</th>
        <th>Includes</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Day 1 Ticket (March 14)</td><td>$6.00</td><td>Live Stream + Rashid Outfit 1 Color EX1</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Day 2 Ticket (March 15)</td><td>$6.00</td><td>Live Stream + Rashid Outfit 1 Color EX1</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Full Bundle</td><td>$10.00</td><td>Both Days + Bonus Legacy Content</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Battle Hub (In-Game)</td><td>FREE</td><td>Standard Stream Access</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

Those who choose to purchase the paid tickets will receive a "Special Color" skin for the character Rashid (Outfit 1 Color EX1) as a digital incentive.

## The Road to Ryogoku

The focus now shifts back to the competition itself. Capcom Cup 12 is scheduled to run from March 11 to March 15, 2026. The 48-player bracket will determine the undisputed world champion, who will claim the grand prize in the heart of Tokyo.

The "Group Stage" elimination rounds (March 11-13) remain entirely free to watch on Twitch and YouTube. The revised pay-per-view model applies only to the "Finals Weekend," which includes the Top 16-to-Champion run and the *Street Fighter League: World Championship 2025* conclusion.
