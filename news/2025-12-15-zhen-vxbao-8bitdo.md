## 8BitDo Taps Chinese Powerhouses

In a move solidifying the bridge between competitive performance and peripheral design, 8BitDo announced the collaboration today. The partnership leverages the massive popularity of **Zhen** and **Vxbao**, who have both been instrumental in **KuaiShou Gaming's** recent *Street Fighter League* success.

The centerpiece of this collaboration is a special edition of the 8BitDo Arcade Stick. Differentiating itself from the standard lineup, this model sports a striking "Transparent Purple" chassis. It retains the line's signature **Dynamic Button Layout** where the visual button labels change depending on whether the user is in "Switch" or "PC" mode. While competitive *Street Fighter 6* is primarily played on PC and PS5, the inclusion of Switch compatibility is a staple of 8BitDo's engineering, allowing the stick to function as a versatile controller for retro games and modern Nintendo titles alike.
