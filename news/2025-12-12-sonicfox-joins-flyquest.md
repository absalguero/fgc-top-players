## A Legend Finds a New Home

After a period of competing as an independent agent following their departure from Evil Geniuses in late 2023, SonicFox has found a new banner. The announcement solidifies FlyQuest's commitment to the Fighting Game Community (FGC). SonicFox is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, boasting Evo championships across five different game franchises, including *Mortal Kombat*, *Dragon Ball FighterZ*, *Injustice*, and *Skullgirls*.

The move aligns with FlyQuest's aggressive expansion in the FGC space since entering the scene in 2023. By securing a player known for their ability to master new engines and "shift metas" almost instantly, the organization is doubling down on the recently released *2XKO*, a title where SonicFox is expected to define the competitive landscape.

> **"With FlyQuest, I'm looking to aim for even higher than the sky. Limits are meant to be broken after all."**

## Building a Dynasty

This signing marks FlyQuest's first new fighting game player since their initial entry into the genre. The organization's leadership emphasized that SonicFox's addition is key to their vision of building a "FlyQuest FGC dynasty," noting that the team has already seen massive success, including their *Street Fighter League* (SFL) team securing a strong runner-up finish in the US region.

Kevin "PewPewU" Toy, FlyQuest's Esports Project Manager, highlighted that the signing goes beyond tournament results. He noted that SonicFox is the "living and breathing personification" of the values they seek, citing their energy, charisma, and impact on the community as decisive factors.

> **"Fittingly, SonicFox is our first new fighting game player since our entrance into the space - I feel proud that they've trusted us to come on board, and look forward to the new heights we can reach together!"**
> — *Christopher Smith, FlyQuest President & Chief Gaming Officer*
