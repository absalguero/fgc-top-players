* **Mental Fortitude:** MenaRD attributes his success to a "delusional" level of self-belief, stating, "I have to believe I'm the best, or else I'm admitting that there's somebody I can't beat."

## The Bull’s Historic Run

The "Evo Legends" feature, powered by Qiddiya, drops just as the 2026 season begins to heat up, serving as a stark reminder of the mountain every other competitor has to climb. The documentary provides unprecedented access to MenaRD’s mindset during his 2025 campaign, where he achieved the rare feat of unifying the global Evo titles, a milestone that eluded even the gods of the *Street Fighter IV* and *V* eras.

While fans are familiar with his breakout Capcom Cup 2017 win as a teenager, this new footage delves into the emotional weight of his 2025 run. It contrasts the heartbreak of his Evo 2023 loss against AngryBird with the "divine" redemption arc that followed. MenaRD describes his mental state during the Evo Japan 2025 Grand Finals against Ryukichi not as a high-pressure situation, but as an inevitability.

> **"I believe that I am the best Street Fighter 6 player in the world for sure... It’s not 10,000 people watching. It’s just the FGC and me."**
> *MenaRD, 2-Time Evo Champion*

The feature also highlights the cultural impact of his success. MenaRD recalls the days of watching his brother play through a window because he wasn't allowed inside, contrasting it with his current status where the Dominican ambassador to Japan attends his matches.

## What’s Next

With the 2026 season officially underway, the target on MenaRD's back has never been larger. The documentary closes with MenaRD acknowledging that while he has achieved everything there is to win, including Capcom Cup, Evo Japan, and Evo Las Vegas, his hunger remains. He aims to leave the community better than he found it, but not before defending his throne against the rising tide of new challengers in the upcoming Capcom Pro Tour.
