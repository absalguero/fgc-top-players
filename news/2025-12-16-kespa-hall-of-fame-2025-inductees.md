## The 2025 Class: Korea's Fighting Game Icons Honored

The 2025 induction ceremony took place at the Sangam SOOP Colosseum in Seoul, celebrating the athletes who pushed their respective titles to new heights. The "Stars" category, which is determined by a massive public vote involving over 27,000 fans, saw two of the world's premier Tekken 8 players take the stage. 

Lim "Ulsan" Soo-hoon’s induction comes on the heels of a historic season where his mastery of Dragunov through multiple balance shifts revolutionized the high-level meta, proving the character’s viability even after significant nerfs and culminating in a legendary run at the Esports World Cup. Alongside him, the veteran "Tekken God" Bae "Knee" Jae-min was honored once again, proving that his fundamentals and legacy remain the gold standard for the community.

In addition to the fan-voted stars, the "Heroes" category (reserved for players who meet rigorous tournament performance criteria) inducted Shin "Leshar" Moon-sup. As one of the most consistent Street Fighter 6 players in the region, Leshar’s inclusion signals KeSPA's continued investment in the Capcom Pro Tour circuit and the growth of the SF6 community in Korea.
