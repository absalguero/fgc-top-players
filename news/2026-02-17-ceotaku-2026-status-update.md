**Alex Jebailey** has announced that **CEOtaku**, the premier anime fighting game major, does not have an event lined up for 2026, citing significant challenges with scheduling and venue selection.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Indefinite Hiatus:** Jebailey stated there are no plans for CEOtaku in 2026, as finding a venue comparable to the Wyndham with non-conflicting dates has proven difficult.
* **Focus on CEO 2026:** The organizer urged the anime community to attend the main **CEO 2026** event (August 14-16), promising "more Anime featured titles than ever" and sufficient space for the community.
* **Not a Cancellation:** Jebailey emphasized that the brand is not dead, stating, "I promise, CEOtaku will always be on my mind to bring back one day when the timing is right."

## Logistical Hurdles Pause CEOtaku

In a transparent update to the community, CEO Gaming Director Alex Jebailey addressed the status of CEOtaku, the beloved spin-off tournament dedicated to "anime" fighters like *Guilty Gear*, *BlazBlue*, and *Melty Blood*. Despite coming "very close" to securing an event last year, Jebailey revealed that date conflicts and the high bar set by previous venues have stalled the tournament's return for 2026.

The primary obstacle remains finding a location that offers the same "24-hour FGC lifestyle" experience as the previous Wyndham venue, without clashing with an increasingly crowded esports calendar.

> **"In a dream world, I do want to bring it to where CEO prime currently exists at a Rosen Property but finding the right dates and taking a risk for another standalone event would not be as easy as it was when we first started CEOtaku."**

## Anime Games to Feature Heavily at CEO 2026

With the standalone anime major on hold, Jebailey is pivoting his focus to the main CEO 2026 event, scheduled for August 14-16 at the Rosen Shingle Creek. He directly addressed fans who typically skip the main event in favor of the anime-focused spin-off, assuring them that the summer major will accommodate their scene better than ever before.

The larger venue capacity at the Rosen Shingle Creek allows for a massive roster of anime titles under one roof, potentially mitigating the need for a separate event in the short term.

> **"If you were holding out for a CEOtaku this year, I suggest making it out to CEO 2026 on August 14-16 if you have the means. It's shaping up to be an incredible event based on early numbers and we're still 6 months away."**

## Commitment to the Future

Despite the hiatus, Jebailey was careful to dispel any "doom & gloom," stating that the decision is purely logistical and not a reflection of the scene's health. He reaffirmed his commitment to the CEOtaku brand, promising to revive it when the conditions are right to deliver a special experience.

> **"I promise, CEOtaku will always be on my mind to bring back one day when the timing is right. I'm not done with it yet. Until then support your local communities."**
