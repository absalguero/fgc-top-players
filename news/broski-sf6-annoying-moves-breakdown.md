In the evolving landscape of **Street Fighter 6**, certain special moves have transcended "strong" to become absolutely infuriating. A recent community thread sparked a debate on the most hated moves in the game, prompting top-level competitor and content creator **Broski** to weigh in.

In his latest video, Broski does not just validate your rage. He offers high-level counterplay to the meta’s biggest offenders. From Mai’s oppressive fans to Ryu’s safe pressure, here is the essential guide to dealing with SF6's most annoying moves.

## 1. The Crown Jewel of Annoyance: Mai’s EX Fan
Broski did not mince words, declaring **Mai’s EX Fan** arguably the "best special move in the game right now."

* **Why It Is Hated:** It forces two consecutive mix-ups. Even if you block or parry the initial projectile, Mai can approach with a Drive Rush, throw, or shimmy while the fan falls. This creates a "checkmate" scenario where she gets multiple turns on offense.
* **The Broski Counter:**
    * **The "Forward-Moving" Parry:** Perfect Parrying is standard, but you are often still pinned down. Broski suggests using normals that advance your character forward (like **A.K.I.'s st.MP**) immediately after the parry. This moves your hurtbox past the falling fan and allows for a punish.
    * **The "Tactical Face-Plant":** A galaxy-brain tech involves using a non-EX DP (like Ryu’s Medium DP) to check Mai’s approach. Even if you get hit by the falling fan, being airborne forces a soft knockdown/reset. This prevents Mai from getting a full combo or loop.

## 2. Ryu’s Hashogeki: The "Safe" Neutral Skip
While Ryu is often seen as "honest," Broski highlights that **Light Hashogeki** and the **EX Hashogeki** strings have become bordering on unfair.

* **Why It Is Hated:** Light Hashogeki is safe on block and leads to massive damage on counter-hit, making it the best jab-string ender in the game. Meanwhile, the `cr.HP > EX Hashogeki` string is gapless, plus on block (+3), and drains nearly 1.5 bars of Drive Gauge.
* **The Broski Counter:**
    * Unfortunately, options are limited. This is a "Perfect Parry or Die" situation. Broski advises that if you do not have an invincible reversal ready, your best bet is often to just **block and take your turn** on the -3 disadvantage rather than risking 60% of your life bar trying to mash.

## 3. M. Bison’s Scissor Kicks
Bison’s signature pressure tool returns with a vengeance, stripping away the charge requirement in SF6.

* **Why It Is Hated:** Light and Medium versions are -5 on block, but the pushback is so severe that most characters cannot punish them. This allows Bison to reset neutral for free.
* **The Broski Counter:**
    * **Preemptive Neutral Jumps:** Catching Bison in the startup is the safest deterrent.
    * **Walk-Up Block:** By walking forward into the scissors’ range, you force the move to hit "deep." This reduces the pushback and potentially makes it punishable.
    * **Knowledge Check:** Watch out for **Heavy Scissor Kicks**. It travels further but is only **-4**. Do not try to punish this with a 5-frame button, or you will get counter-hit.

## 4. The "Skill Checks": JP and Terry
Broski also addressed complaints about **JP’s Command Grab** and **Terry’s Burn Knuckle**, classifying them more as knowledge checks than broken moves.

* **JP’s Command Grab:** Broski calls this a "skill issue." The move is designed to punish players who autopilot-parry.
    * **The Drill:** Set a dummy to randomize between Heavy Punch into Fireball, Feint, or Grab. Practice reacting with a jump specifically for the grab animation.
* **Terry’s Burn Knuckle:** This move is only plus-on-block if spaced perfectly (about 2/3 screen).
    * **The Fix:** Use footwork. Rapidly moving back and forth at that range disrupts Terry’s spacing. This causes the Burn Knuckle to either whiff or hit too close (making it unsafe).

## 5. Blanka Ball: The Drive Gauge Eater
Finally, the classic menace. Blanka Ball is notorious for being hard to punish even after a Perfect Parry due to pushback.

* **The Broski Counter:**
    * **Dash, Don’t Mash:** Many players panic-mash a button after a Perfect Parry and whiff. Broski reveals that after Perfect Parrying a Heavy/EX Blanka Ball, you are often plus enough (+14 or more) to simply **forward dash** and still get a full grounded punish.

## Final Verdict: The "Parry" Meta
A recurring theme in Broski’s analysis is that SF6's most annoying moves share one trait: **the only reliable counterplay is often a Perfect Parry.** Whether it is Mai’s fan or Ken’s Jinrai kicks, the meta demands high-precision defense to stop these offensive loops.
