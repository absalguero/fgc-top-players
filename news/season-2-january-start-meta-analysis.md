SNK has officially confirmed that **Season 2 will begin in January 2026**. This announcement comes immediately after the release of Mr. Big and signals a much tighter release window than many expected.

For the competitive community, this is a promising development. A faster release schedule suggests that SNK is prioritizing roster expansion as a primary method of balancing the game. If the developer can introduce new archetypes quickly, it may naturally erode the dominance of the current top tiers without requiring heavy-handed nerfs.

## The Evidence: Why These Characters are Expected

While SNK has not officially named the Season 2 cast, the community has strong reason to believe specific veterans are on the way. These predictions are based on datamined placeholder IDs found in the game files earlier this year.

These files listed character slots with specific "PL" (Player) tags that correspond to legacy characters. While plans can always change during development, these remain our most credible leads.

* **Blue Mary (The Grappler Hybrid) - *Datamine Reference: PL025*:** Blue Mary has been a consistent presence in the leaked file lists. Her inclusion would fill a major gap in the current roster. Right now, the game lacks a dedicated hybrid grappler who can threaten the top tiers up close. A character with Mary's command grabs would force high tiers to respect close-range situations rather than mindlessly pressuring with safe block strings.
* **Duck King (The Anti-Zoner) - *Datamine Reference: PL033*:** Duck King is another name that appeared in the initial file scrubs. In previous titles, Duck King functioned as a high-mobility character who could weave through projectiles. This archetype is currently missing in *City of the Wolves*. His addition would give players a viable counter-pick against zoning-heavy strategies which are currently very strong in the meta.
* **Kim Jae Hoon (The Technical Rushdown) - *Datamine Reference: PL003*:** Files for Kim Kaphwan's son were found alongside the base roster data, suggesting he was worked on early in development. If he releases in Season 2, he would likely offer a high-execution rushdown style similar to his father but with the added "fire" mechanics seen in *Garou: Mark of the Wolves*.

## Fixing the Meta: More Tools, More Answers

The current competitive conversation focuses heavily on ["The Wall"](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/japanese-pros-define-the-wall-in-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-tier-list/), a concept defined by Japanese pros to describe the massive gap between the top three characters (Hotaru, Kain, Hokutomaru) and the rest of the cast. A rapid succession of new characters helps solve this problem by introducing necessary competitive checks.

The best way to balance a fighting game is often to introduce characters who naturally counter the top tiers. Currently, Kain R. Heinlein dominates the mid-range because few characters can contest his pokes safely. Introducing a character with armor or superior whiff punishing tools forces Kain players to play more cautiously. This balances the game by giving players the right tool for the job rather than simply weakening Kain.

## Evolving the REV System

When a roster is small, top players often gravitate toward "safe" picks that have no bad matchups. As the roster grows in Season 2, the likelihood of a "perfect" character decreases. If Season 2 introduces 4 to 6 new fighters, pros will have to learn specific counter-picks. This rewards players who have deep character pools and understand system mechanics rather than those who just master one strong fighter.

Furthermore, as we analyzed in our [breakdown of Patch 1.6.0](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/mr-big-vs-the-wall-can-patch-160-save-the-city-of-the-wolves-meta/), new characters bring unique interactions with the REV Meter. Mr. Big has already shown how a character with a unique parry mechanic can change how opponents use their meter. Future characters will likely introduce similar innovations. This keeps the game fresh for spectators and ensures that the "solved" meta of Season 1 does not become permanent.
