## The King Joins Varmilo

The peripheral manufacturer Varmilo Arcade announced on January 2 that Taiwanese fighting game veteran ET has signed on as an official brand ambassador. This move solidifies a relationship that began unofficially late last year.

ET, widely recognized as one of the greatest *The King of Fighters* players in history, road-tested the hardware during Taiwan’s BeePro Cup in late 2025. He secured the championship title for *Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves* at that event while using the Varmilo Kassai leverless controller, demonstrating the hardware's viability at the highest level of play.

> **"Our journey actually started last year, when ET used the Varmilo Kassai at Taiwan’s BeePro Cup and took home the championship. His skill, passion, and commitment to the community have always inspired us."**
