In the world of esports, fighting games occupy a unique and passionate niche. Tournaments for *Tekken* and *Street Fighter* generate millions of views, trending hashtags, and careers for content creators. Yet, according to *Tekken* series executive producer Katsuhiro Harada, there is a glaring hole in this economy. In a recent interview, Harada noted that the game creators themselves barely see a financial return from this ecosystem.

Harada sparked a fresh conversation on esports monetization by admitting he is "quite interested" in the controversial pay-per-view models currently being tested by rival studios. His comments shed light on the growing tension between publishers, tournament organizers, and the influencers who profit from the scene.

## Who Actually Makes the Money?
A common misconception is that tournament organizers generate significant profit from entry fees and venue tickets. In reality, the financial picture for events is far more difficult. While Bandai Namco establishes the structure of the *Tekken World Tour* and provides supplemental prize pools, the events themselves are largely operated by third-party organizers. These organizers shoulder the heavy costs of venue rental, equipment, staff, and logistics. Industry insights suggest that many of these tournaments operate on razor-thin margins or even at a loss.

If the developers are not making money from tournaments and the organizers are barely breaking even, the revenue flow becomes a central question for the sustainability of the scene.

## The Influencer Economy vs. Development Costs
Harada identified the external content ecosystem as a primary beneficiary of the current model. He explained that large companies invest money into advertisements for events and influencers earn significant revenue from their streams, but the revenue for the games does not reflect this activity.

Streamers and content creators monetize tournament interest directly through ad revenue and brand sponsorships. They capture the financial attention of the audience while the stakeholders who built the game receive no direct kickback. This occurs as development costs continue to rise. *Tekken 8* reportedly cost significantly more to produce than its predecessor, which pressures studios to find new revenue streams beyond initial software sales.

## The Capcom Experiment
This financial imbalance explains Harada's keen interest in the strategies adopted by competitors. The conversation surrounding monetization recently intensified after the [Capcom Cup 12 pay-per-view announcement](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/capcom-cup-12-finals-move-to-pay-per-view-sparking-fgc-debate/), a decision that effectively turns the esports audience into paying customers rather than passive consumers.

Harada views this move as a critical test case for the industry. The decision faced immediate community pushback, leading to a follow-up announcement where [Capcom confirmed a pricing update is coming](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/capcom-says-ppv-pricing-update-coming-for-capcom-cup-12-and-sfl-world-championship/) for the finals. If fans prove willing to pay for premium tournament broadcasts despite the initial backlash, it could pave the way for a new economic model that supports developers and organizers alike.

## Future Implications
Harada suggests that the era of free global finals might be nearing a crossroads. While Bandai Namco has not announced similar paywalls for the *Tekken World Tour*, the executive producer is closely monitoring how the market reacts to paid viewership. If the industry shifts toward paid streaming or stricter licensing fees, it would fundamentally change how the community consumes competitive fighting games.
