## The MVP Who Almost Quit

While the Fighting Game Community celebrated GO1's "Player of the Year" victory, the recipient revealed he almost wasn't there to accept it. In a candid post-ceremony interview, the DetonatioN FocusMe star disclosed that he had privately decided 2025 would be his final year in competitive play.

The admission adds a heavy layer of context to his phenomenal season. While spectators watched him dominate EVO and the Esports World Cup in *City of the Wolves*, GO1 was battling internal doubts about his longevity. He feared that his physical faculties, which are essential for his legendary defensive style, were deteriorating beyond repair.

> **"I was thinking of retiring in 2025... but friends like Dogura and KEI.B... judged that I should continue as a pro. They untangled things for me from a third-party perspective and encouraged me, saying 'No, you are still strong'."**

## Fighting "The Old Man" Narrative

For years, the "reaction time cliff" has been a topic of debate in the FGC. GO1 admitted that he felt the impact of age, noting that his concentration and reactions were not what they used to be. However, the intervention from his peers shifted his perspective. Instead of relying solely on raw twitch reflexes, he began to adapt his mental stack to accommodate his current physical state.

He highlighted this shift when discussing his aggressive play in *Street Fighter 6* during the World Warrior Japan events. Rather than trying to out-react younger opponents on every interaction, he embraced the grueling nature of long sets.

> **"I played with the spirit that if it's tough for me, it's tough for the opponent too."**

## Peer Support & Analysis

The revelation that his friends saved his career highlights the importance of support systems in high-level esports. Dogura and KEI.B did not just offer emotional support. They intervened with tactical analysis.

According to GO1, his own assessment of his skills had become warped by anxiety over his age. Dogura and KEI.B stepped in to provide a "third-party perspective." They reviewed his gameplay objectively and determined that his perceived decline was not reflected in the actual data or match results. They "untangled" his doubts by showing him that his fundamentals and decision-making were still elite, convincing him that his retirement plans were premature.

This guidance allowed GO1 to maintain an intense practice schedule. He reported training over 12 hours a day throughout 2025, splitting time between *Street Fighter 6* and *City of the Wolves*.

## What’s Next

With the retirement scare behind him, GO1 has recommitted to the grind for 2026. His "Player of the Year" award serves as validation that his adapted playstyle is working. He has stated he is open to picking up even more games in the future "if there is a pro scene and a title I want to challenge."
