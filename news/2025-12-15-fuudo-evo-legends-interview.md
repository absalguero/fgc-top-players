## The Road from Chiba to Champion

In the detailed interview, Keita "Fuudo" Ai broke down his origins in Minami-Funabashi, Chiba. Growing up in a town known for its eclectic mix of a racecourse and indoor ski slopes, Fuudo began his competitive journey at a family-friendly arcade in the LaLaport shopping mall. While he cut his teeth on *The King of Fighters '97* and rhythm games, the lack of high-level competition eventually pushed him to the legendary "Funabashi Fan" arcade.

It was there that Fuudo discovered *Virtua Fighter*, drawn in by the game’s ranking system. His rise was rapid, and within six months, he qualified for a national tournament. By 2005, he had cemented his legacy in that scene, leading a team of young upstarts to victory against established veterans. This signaled a generational shift in the *Virtua Fighter* meta.

Despite his success, Fuudo sought new challenges. When *Street Fighter IV* released, he transitioned games specifically to challenge legends he hadn't faced before, such as Daigo Umehara and Nemo. This shift culminated in his historic run at EVO 2011. Even with Yun and Yang being highly evaluated at the time, Fuudo stuck to Fei Long, confident that the character was a hard counter to them.

> **"I have very little resistance to losing. I enjoyed the process of learning from skilled players rather than feeling discouraged."**
> — *Fuudo, Professional Player*

## Family as the Ultimate Buff

Beyond the bracket runs and frame data, Fuudo opened up about the mental side of his longevity in the FGC. Unlike the "stoic athlete" archetype often associated with Japanese fighting game gods, Fuudo approached EVO 2011 with a "festival" mindset. He prioritized fun and community over pressure.

However, his motivation shifted significantly after starting a family. Addressing a common stigma in the esports world, Fuudo expressed a fierce determination to prove that marriage and fatherhood would not dull his competitive edge.

> **"I thought it would be pitiful for my family if people said, 'He got weak because he got married.' I worked harder to ensure that didn't happen."**
> — *Fuudo, Professional Player*

This mindset has allowed him to remain a top contender in the modern era. He balances his responsibilities while continuing to adapt to new titles like *Street Fighter 6*.

## What’s Next

As the upcoming Capcom Cup approaches, Fuudo remains a critical figure to watch. His ability to adapt, proven by his shift from *Virtua Fighter* to *Street Fighter*, suggests he will continue to be a threat in major brackets.
