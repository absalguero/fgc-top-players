Phenom’s latest rankings offer valuable insight into the current *Street Fighter 6* meta, and when we compare them with our CPV-based tier list, interesting patterns emerge. The comparison highlights where professional experience and statistical performance align, and where perspectives diverge in ways that enrich the community’s understanding of the game.

## Alignments Between Phenom and Data

Some of Phenom’s top placements match closely with competitive results. For example, **Ryu** is in S-tier on both Phenom’s list and our site’s rankings, where he holds a **CPV of 99.99**, the highest in the game. Phenom’s recognition of Ryu’s rise reflects the character’s recent buffs and consistent high-level performances across global events.

Similarly, **Ed** earns a spot among the best on both lists, with a **CPV of 94.40** in our data. These shared rankings reinforce the idea that Ryu and Ed have established themselves as cornerstones of the *SF6* meta. They are versatile, powerful, and tournament-proven.

## Positive Divergences

Some placements showcase Phenom’s distinct perspective as a top competitor. **Chun-Li**, for example, is in **A-tier** on Phenom’s list but sits in **S-tier** on our site with a CPV of **92.03**. This isn’t a disagreement so much as a difference in approach. Phenom may be factoring in how demanding she is to play at peak efficiency, while the data reflects her consistent tournament results. Together, these viewpoints give players a more complete picture of her true potential.

**JP** is another example. Phenom ranks him higher than our B-tier CPV placement, suggesting he values JP’s oppressive zoning and control tools more heavily than results data alone might indicate. This kind of variance is valuable, it encourages players to look deeper at characters that can thrive in the right hands or under specific conditions.

**Ken**, a long-time fan favorite, sees one of the largest contrasts. Phenom places him in **B+ tier**, whereas our CPV metrics position him in **C-tier (17.79)**. While tournament numbers show Ken’s dominance tapering off since earlier patches, Phenom’s continued faith in the character points to how strong Ken remains in practiced hands and certain matchups.

## Shared Takeaways

These differences don’t signal disagreement. They show the depth of the *Street Fighter 6* competitive landscape. Phenom’s list captures the feel of the meta from a top player’s viewpoint, while our data measures aggregate performance across thousands of matches. When viewed together, they provide a richer and more balanced understanding of which characters are thriving now, and which could be next to break through.
