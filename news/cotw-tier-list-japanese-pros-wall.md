A recent gathering of Japanese fighting game legends has produced a definitive tier list for *Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves* (CotW). The stream featured a panel of four highly respected competitors: **GO1**, **Nemo**, **Score**, and **KojiKOG**.

These players represent the highest level of competition. **GO1** is a multiple-time EVO champion who won the *City of the Wolves* title at EVO 2025 and the Esports World Cup 2025. **Nemo** is a celebrated professional known for his high placements at major global tournaments like CEO 2025 and EVO Japan. **Score** is a legendary veteran with decades of experience in SNK titles like *The King of Fighters* and *Samurai Shodown*. **KojiKOG** is a top-level competitor who placed 5th in *City of the Wolves* at EVO 2025.

The group identified a significant power gap in the current meta. They visualized this gap using a tier labeled "The Wall" (Kabe) which separates the top three characters from the rest of the cast.

## The Top Three

The panel placed three characters above "The Wall" in the S and A tiers. These fighters possess superior tools for controlling the neutral game and punishing opponents.

* **Hotaru Futaba (S Tier):** Hotaru sits alone at the top of the ranking. The players noted that her dominance in tournament brackets has been absolute, referring to recent events as a "Hotaru Festival."
* **Kain R. Heinlein (A Tier):** The *Garou* boss character remains a top-tier threat. While chat commentators noted that Kain has "dropped quite a bit" compared to earlier versions, the pros maintained that he is still firmly above the rest of the cast.
* **Hokutomaru (A Tier):** Andy Bogard’s student, Hokutomaru, rounds out the top three. His high mobility and mix-up potential place him firmly above the rest of the cast.

## Below The Wall

The B Tier contains the characters that reside immediately below the power gap. This section highlights fighters like **Marco Rodrigues**, **Gato**, and **Kim Dong Hwan**. The panel designated these fighters as the viable portion of the roster, but noted that they play a fundamentally harder game than the top three.

The discussion emphasized that while these characters are competitive, they cannot replicate the oppressive control of the S and A tiers. The presence of "The Wall" suggests that for characters in the B Tier to win, they must outplay their opponents significantly to overcome the inherent toolkit advantages of characters like Hotaru.

## Conclusion

The data provided by GO1, Nemo, Score, and KojiKOG highlights a centralized metagame in *City of the Wolves*. While the B Tier contains a diverse range of viable fighters, the presence of "The Wall" indicates that Hotaru, Kain, and Hokutomaru currently operate on a different level of performance. This ranking serves as a snapshot of the competitive hierarchy established by the game's most successful players in 2025.
