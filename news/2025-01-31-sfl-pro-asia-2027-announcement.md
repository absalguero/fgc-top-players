## Capcom Targets Asian Expansion with New League

Capcom announced on Saturday that the Street Fighter League (SFL) ecosystem will officially expand to include a dedicated **Pro-Asia** division in 2027. This move is designed to further energize and unify the competitive scene across the entire Asian region, providing a stable professional platform for players who currently sit outside the Japan, US, or Europe league structures.

The launch of Pro-Asia marks a significant strategic shift. By creating a fourth major region, Capcom is acknowledging the immense density of high-level Street Fighter 6 talent across the continent. This expansion is expected to create a more robust pipeline for players to qualify for the annual World Championship, potentially leading to a broader global format in the future.

## Preparing for the 2027 Kickoff

Although the new league is set for 2027, the groundwork begins now. Capcom has stated that the 2026 season will serve as a bridge, with full details regarding team organizations, regional boundaries, and prize pools expected to be released throughout the year.

Closer to home, the established **SFL Pro-JP** will maintain its 12-team, two-division format for the 2026 season. However, the barrier to entry has officially been lowered. Starting in 2026, the minimum age for participation in the Japanese league will be 15. This change allows a new generation of prodigies to join the professional ranks, many of whom have already made waves in online competitions but were previously ineligible due to age restrictions.
