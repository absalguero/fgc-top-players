**The Best Street Fighter 6 Player of 2025** has been named by FGC analyst and competitor Broski in his latest video. He confirms that Dominican Republic powerhouse MenaRD sits atop his personal list following a historic season.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **MenaRD’s Historic Run:** He became the first player to secure the "triumvirate" of EVO, Capcom Cup, and Street Fighter League victories.
* **Leshar’s Consistency:** The South Korean phenom was the only player to reach Top 8 in every CPT event he entered this year.
* **Xiaohai’s Multitasking:** The Chinese legend secured a top-four spot while simultaneously competing professionally in *Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves*.

## Broski's Top 5 Breakdown

Broski released his ranking of the top five **Street Fighter 6** competitors for the 2025 season. He emphasized that the list is subjective but weighted by tournament results and match footage. This lineup shakes up the conversation compared to our own site rankings. We currently have Leshar at number one and MenaRD at number two.

While notables like Punk, EndingWalker, and AngryBird received honorable mentions, they fell just short of the top five due to the overwhelming consistency and peaks of the selected players.

### 5. Sahara (Japan)
Sahara claims the fifth spot off the back of his lightning-fast decision-making. We currently rank the Japanese competitor at number twelve so Broski places him much higher. Broski highlighted a sequence from the UFA Grand Finals where Sahara made five correct reads in under two seconds. This showcases the reaction time that defines his playstyle.

### 4. Xiaohai (China)
The Esports World Cup (EWC) champion lands at number four. This is a few spots above our ranking of seventh. Xiaohai’s 2025 is defined by mental fortitude. He defeated giants like Punk and AngryBird to win EWC while actively competing in *Fatal Fury* and *KOF XV*. His ability to recover instantly from dropped game-winning combos remains his defining trait. This was clearly seen against Blaz.

### 3. Blaz (South America)
Finishing second at Capcom Cup and sweeping all five of his region's World Warrior events puts Blaz at number three. This aligns perfectly with our current ranking for the South American prodigy. He transitioned to Sagat late in the season after primarily using Ryu, a move that unlocked specific anti-meta preparation against characters like A.K.I. This allowed him to punish escape options that other world-class players often ignore.

### 2. Leshar (South Korea)
Broski describes Leshar as possessing "inhuman reactions" and puts him at number two. While we award him the number one spot for his unmatched consistency, Broski acknowledges his dominance with a strong runner-up placement. The South Korean star achieved a perfect Top 8 record in CPT events (7 for 7) and won major titles at Combo Breaker and CEO. His technical precision is exemplified by his ability to single-hit confirm Ed’s crouch light kick into Super. This technique is utilized to break Drive Impacts on reaction.

### 1. MenaRD (Dominican Republic)
Taking the crown is MenaRD as the "Best Player of 2025" in Broski's eyes. We have him closely following Leshar at number two. His season included winning both EVO and EVO Japan in the same calendar year. Broski dissected the EVO Grand Finals against Kakeru. He noted how MenaRD mentally dismantled his opponent by reading wake-up options and forcing errors to solidify his status as the number one pick.

## What’s Next

However, as Broski’s analysis suggests, challengers like Leshar and Blaz have the specific technical preparation to potentially dethrone the king.
