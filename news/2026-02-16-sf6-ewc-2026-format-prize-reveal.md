The organizers of the **Esports World Cup (EWC)** have confirmed the tournament structure for *Street Fighter 6* in 2026, announcing a $1,000,000 prize pool and the return of the stamina-testing format for the finals.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Format Returns:** The grueling **Best-of-9 (Bo9)** Single Elimination bracket for Top 8 remains the standard for the third consecutive year.
* **Champion Returns:** Two-time EWC champion **xiaohai** qualifies automatically to defend his crown.
* **SFL Lock-In:** The 12 players comprising the top teams from the *Street Fighter League* global circuit have officially punched their tickets to Riyadh.

## The Road to Riyadh

The EWC has released the full roadmap for its *Street Fighter 6* tournament, scheduled to take place from **July 28 to July 31, 2026**. While the seven-figure prize pool draws attention, the qualification metrics continue to emphasize team-based performance through the Street Fighter League (SFL) circuit.

The 2026 iteration grants 12 slots to the top teams from the *Street Fighter League: World Championship 2025*. This block ensures that the strongest squads from the global leagues transfer directly into the EWC group stages.

## Qualification Breakdown: SFL Giants Arrive

The 32-player bracket is strictly curated. Outside of the massive SFL block, spots are reserved for the reigning EWC Title Defender and top performers from Capcom Cup 12.

**xiaohai**, who secured back-to-back titles in 2024 and 2025, has already confirmed his spot as the Title Defender. His dominance at this event forces the rest of the field to chase the "King of EWC" once again.

Joining him are the 12 competitors from the SFL World Championship teams.

## The Remaining Field

While the SFL and Title Defender slots account for 13 players, the remaining 19 spots will be filled through a mix of established major results and open qualifiers.

* **Capcom Cup 12 (4 Slots):** The top performers from Capcom's official world championship will earn direct invites. This ensures that players who peak in the official circuit have a direct path to the EWC stage.
* **EWC Last Chance Qualifier (4 Slots):** A grueling open bracket held on-site in Riyadh days before the main event. Historically, this has been the path for dark horses and players whose regions lacked representation.
* **To Be Announced (11 Slots):** The largest remaining block of invites. These are expected to be distributed among major regional tournaments (like EVO Japan or CEO) or via global leaderboard standings, though specific details have yet to be revealed.

## Format Analysis: The Endurance Test Continues

The tournament maintains the distinct three-stage format that separates the EWC from other major FGC events.

* **Stage 1 (Group Stage 1):** 32 players divided into 4 groups. Double Elimination, **Best of 5**. Top 4 from each group advance.
* **Stage 2 (Group Stage 2):** 16 players divided into 2 groups. Double Elimination, **Best of 5**. Top 4 from each group advance.
* **Stage 3 (Playoff):** The Top 8 shifts to a Single Elimination bracket played as **Best of 9**.

This "First to 5" structure for the finals removes the bracket reset mechanic found in standard double-elimination tournaments. Instead, it demands deep adaptation over a long set. While initially controversial when introduced in 2024, the format has become a signature element of the Riyadh event, favoring players with deep character pools and high stamina.

## Looking Ahead

With 13 of the 32 slots now occupied by xiaohai and the SFL powerhouses, the scramble for the remaining invitations begins. The 11 "To Be Announced" slots will likely be filled through regional qualifiers or major community events in the coming months. For competitors, the path to the $1,000,000 prize pool requires navigating one of the most difficult brackets in the annual calendar, now populated by the absolute strongest teams in the world.
