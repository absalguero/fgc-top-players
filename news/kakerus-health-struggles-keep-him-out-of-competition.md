Top Japanese *Street Fighter 6* competitor **Kakeru** has been sidelined from tournament play due to ongoing health issues that have reportedly worsened over recent months. The talented player, known for his exceptional JP gameplay and high tournament placements, is now focusing on recovery after withdrawing from the **Esports World Cup (EWC)** mid-event.

## EWC Withdrawal Sparks Concern

## A Sudden Pause in a Promising Season  
Kakeru’s absence has left a noticeable gap in the Street Fighter 6 competitive scene. Before stepping back, he was considered one of Japan’s strongest and most consistent performers, regularly placing in the top brackets of premier tournaments.  

Since EWC, Kakeru has **not appeared in any major events**, and his future participation remains uncertain. His fans and peers across the FGC have expressed widespread support and well-wishes, hoping to see him return to competition once his health allows.

## The Community Stands Behind Him  
While little is publicly known about his medical condition, the sentiment across the fighting game community is unified: respect Kakeru’s privacy and wish him strength in his recovery. Many players, commentators, and fans have voiced their admiration for his contributions to *Street Fighter 6* and their anticipation for his eventual comeback.
