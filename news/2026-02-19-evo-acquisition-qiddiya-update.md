## Preserving the Fighting Game Heritage

Despite the major shift in ownership, organizers emphasize that the grassroots identity of the event will remain untouched. RTS has pledged to keep the traditions and values of the tournament intact. The move aligns the competition with Qiddiya City's expansive Gaming and Esports District. This massive hub features four dedicated arenas and a huge seating capacity designed to centralize global competitive play.

> "Evo is a global gaming institution, built on community, competition, and creativity. Through RTS and Qiddiya City, we are committed to supporting Evo's long-term growth in a way that respects its heritage and strengthens its role within the global Fighting Game Community. This is about investing in the future of play, and safeguarding what makes Evo special."
> — *Muhannad AlDawood, Chief Strategy Officer at Qiddiya Investment Company*

> "We are proud of our legacy with Evo that started 5 years ago. We're going to continue investing in the things that matter to our community, elevating and empowering members of the FGC and working diligently with our game developer partners to ensure that Evo benefits all involved parties"
> — *Stuart Saw, Chief Executive Officer at RTS*

## Qiddiya City Infrastructure Plans

The acquisition directly ties the fighting game community to the development of a purpose-built esports hub in Saudi Arabia. The planned district spans over 183,000 square meters. It will house regional headquarters for more than thirty gaming companies. This massive scale of investment builds directly upon Qiddiya Investment Company's strategic September 2025 acquisition of RTS.
