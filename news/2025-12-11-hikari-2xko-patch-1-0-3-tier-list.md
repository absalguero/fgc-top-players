The **2XKO Patch 1.0.3 Tier List** has officially been released by professional competitor Hikari today, confirming that a clear power hierarchy has emerged following the latest balance adjustments.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **The "Big Three":** Yasuo, Ekko, and Ahri are designated as the strongest characters in the current version of the game.
* **Deep S-Tier:** A large portion of the roster, including Teemo and Illaoi, is considered highly viable for high-level play.
* **Specialized Archetypes:** Heavy-hitters and zoners like Braum and Jinx currently sit in the lowest tier, as the meta favors high-mobility rushdown over defensive utility.

## Analyzing the Top 3 and Meta Synergies

Hikari's analysis of Patch 1.0.3 highlights a meta defined by high mobility and oppressive neutral tools. By placing Yasuo, Ekko, and Ahri in a "Top 3" tier of their own, Hikari suggests these characters possess superior utility and synergy compared to the rest of the cast. 

Yasuo and Ekko stand out due to their exceptional neutral tools and ability to control the pace of a match. Ahri complements this by providing versatile support utility, allowing her to fish for hits that lead into high-damage transitions via the game's handshake tag system. These three characters excel at maintaining pressure and forcing defenders into difficult situations, which are the core pillars of the 2XKO engine.

The S-Tier remains crowded, indicating that the gap between the "Big Three" and characters like Warwick or Vi is manageable for skilled players. However, the placement of Jinx and Braum in A-Tier (the lowest tier in this list) suggests that projectile-based zoning and pure defensive playstyles are currently struggling against the rushdown-heavy nature of the top tiers.

## What’s Next

While this tier list defines the current landscape, the meta is on the verge of a massive shift. A significant balance patch is scheduled for January that could completely upend the current hierarchy. Developers are expected to address the dominance of the current top tiers, meaning players may soon see a more varied competitive landscape as the community moves toward major upcoming events.
