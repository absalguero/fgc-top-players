Capcom announced earlier today that **Street Fighter 6** has officially surpassed **6 million copies sold worldwide**. This milestone comes just over two years after its initial release in June 2023, signaling a massive shift in momentum for the franchise compared to the previous generation.

While fighting games often see a sharp drop in sales after the initial launch window, Street Fighter 6 has maintained a steady upward trajectory thanks to its consistent content updates, the thriving "Year 3" roadmap, and the ongoing engagement of the Battle Hub.

## Outpacing the Legacy

To understand the magnitude of this achievement, one only needs to look at the franchise's history. **Street Fighter V**, which launched in 2016, took nearly **five and a half years** to reach the 6 million mark. Street Fighter 6 has accomplished the same feat in less than half that time.

The game is now rapidly approaching the legendary single-SKU sales record held by the original **Street Fighter II** on SNES, which stands at approximately 6.3 million units. At its current pace, Street Fighter 6 is on track to become the best-selling individual Street Fighter release in history before the end of the fiscal year.

## The Battle of the "Big Three"

The fighting game community is currently enjoying a golden age with major entries from all three titans of the genre, and the sales race is closer than ever.

Traditionally, **Mortal Kombat** dominates sales charts in the West by a wide margin. However, the gap is narrowing. **Mortal Kombat 1**, released in September 2023, reported surpassing **6 million units** earlier this year (August 2025). For a Japanese fighting game to be neck-and-neck with NetherRealm's juggernaut this late in their respective lifecycles is almost unprecedented.

Meanwhile, **Tekken 8** (released January 2024) continues to perform well but currently trails its rivals. Bandai Namco reported hitting the **3 million** milestone earlier in 2025. While impressive, Tekken's growth has been more gradual compared to the explosive, sustained performance of Capcom's flagship title.

## What is Next for SF6?

With the successful rollout of **Mai Shiranui**, **Sagat**, and most recently **C. Viper**, Capcom has successfully kept the player base engaged. The inclusion of high-profile guest characters alongside returning legends has been a winning strategy, paying dividends in both player retention and new unit sales.

As the Capcom Cup approaches, all eyes are on whether Street Fighter 6 can maintain this momentum to eventually challenge the 10 million lifetime sales goal Capcom set during launch.
