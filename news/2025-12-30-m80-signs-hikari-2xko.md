## M80 Makes Major FGC Entry with Hikari

While **M80** has rapidly established itself as a powerhouse in tactical shooters like *Rainbow Six: Siege*, *Counter-Strike 2*, and *Valorant*, the organization has remained relatively quiet in the Fighting Game Community until now. Today's acquisition of Jo'siah "Hikari" Miller signals a serious commitment to the genre, placing one of the FGC's most technically gifted players at the helm of their new division.

Hikari is widely recognized as a "lab monster" with exceptional execution, best known for his reign in *Dragon Ball FighterZ*. He captured the EVO Championship Series title in 2023 and successfully defended his global standing with a victory at EVO France 2025.

Since transitioning to **2XKO**, Hikari has remained a constant threat in the bracket. He has secured victories in multiple tournaments held during the game's **early days**, exhibiting a high-level understanding of the game's tag mechanics and champions like Yasuo and Ekko. While the competition has been fierce, his consistent top placements made him a prime target for organizations looking to scout talent.

> **"Hikari isn't just a champion, he's a generational talent who has proven he can dominate at the highest level. As 2XKO prepares for its competitive scene to explode in 2026, there's no one we'd rather have representing M80. His work ethic, competitive drive, and connection with the FGC community align perfectly with everything we're building at M80."**
> — *Marco Mereu, Founder and CEO of M80*

For Hikari, the move represents a shift from independent competition to tier-one organizational backing.

> **"Joining M80 feels like the perfect fit for this next chapter. I've proven what I can do in DBFZ, and now I'm ready to build a legacy in 2XKO. M80 shares my hunger to win and my commitment to the fighting game community. Together, we're going to make some noise."**
