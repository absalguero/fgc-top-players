Evo’s first European stop, **Evo France 2025**, has revealed its final entrant leaderboard, giving a clear picture of player engagement and competitive interest on the continent. Street Fighter 6 leads the pack with 1,654 registrations, followed by Tekken 8 at 1,156. While these figures fall short of the record-breaking attendance at Evo’s flagship events in Las Vegas and Japan, they nevertheless signal solid demand and enthusiasm for a European edition of the world’s premier fighting game tournament.

These numbers also provide insight into which games resonate most with local audiences, helping organizers plan side events, content streams, and competitive brackets for future editions.

Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8 clearly dominate registrations, accounting for the majority of entrants. This demonstrates that marquee titles continue to drive participation, while mid-tier games see more modest turnout.

## Comparing Evo France to Global Editions

To put these figures in context:

- **Evo 2025** in Las Vegas drew several thousand entrants for both Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8.  
- Past editions of Street Fighter 6 have routinely surpassed 4,000–5,000 participants.  
- Evo France’s final numbers are smaller compared to Evo 2025 and Evo Japan 2025, reflecting the natural challenges of launching a new regional event.

Despite the gap, the results are promising for a first European edition, proving there is an active and engaged fighting game community across the continent.
