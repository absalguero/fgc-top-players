The Fighting Game Community (FGC) has always known that **Zeng "Xiao Hai" Zhuojun** is royalty. Now, the rest of the esports world knows it too.

In a prestigious ceremony held in Riyadh this week, the Chinese fighting game god was crowned the **Esports Controller Player of the Year** at the **Esports Awards 2025**. This victory marks a significant milestone for the FGC, as Xiao Hai beat out top competitors from the *Call of Duty*, *Rocket League*, and *Halo* scenes (genres that traditionally dominate this category).

## A Year of Absolute Dominance

Xiao Hai's 2025 resume reads like fiction. At 36 years old (an age where many esports pros are long retired) he did not just compete, he crushed the competition across multiple distinct titles.

* **Street Fighter 6:** He silenced doubters by winning back-to-back titles at the **Esports World Cup (EWC)** in Riyadh, taking home a massive $250,000 prize. His run was legendary, featuring a reverse sweep against **Punk** and a grand finals comeback against the young prodigy **Blaz** using a surprise pick: Mai Shiranui.
* **The King of Fighters XV:** Continuing his reign as the undisputed G.O.A.T. of *KOF*, he secured his fifth franchise title at **Evo 2025** earlier this summer, cementing his legacy as the most decorated player in the game's history.
* **Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:** Proving his adaptability, he became the inaugural champion for *Fatal Fury: CotW* at **Evo Japan 2025**, mastering a brand new game faster than anyone else in the world.

## "I Am Not Too Old Yet"

Xiao Hai's acceptance speech (and his post win interviews) have struck a chord with fans worldwide. After his EWC victory earlier this year, he famously dedicated his win to the younger generation while reminding them that the "old guard" is not done yet.

> *"My age is twice his [Blaz], maybe an old man can keep on going. I want to dedicate this to every single young player and fan... a 15 year old can compete against someone who has played for 30 years."*

This narrative of longevity has become the defining story of his 2025 season. In an era where reaction times are fetishized, Xiao Hai wins with something sharper: decades of match experience and an unshakable mental fortitude.

## The Community Reacts

The FGC has erupted in celebration, viewing this award as a validation of fighting games as a tier 1 esport.

Fellow competitors and legends like **Justin Wong** and **Daigo Umehara** have frequently praised Xiao Hai's unique ability to play "everything" at a world class level. Social media has been flooded with clips of his EWC pop off, where he famously screamed *"I am the champion!"* to a roaring crowd (a moment that likely secured him the votes needed for this global award).

Even players outside the FGC are taking notice. His ability to switch from *Street Fighter* (Capcom) to *KOF* (SNK) mechanics seamlessly is a feat comparable to a pro golfer winning the Masters and then winning Wimbledon the next month.

## What is Next?

With the "Controller Player of the Year" trophy in hand, Xiao Hai shows no signs of slowing down. He is currently competing in the **Street Fighter League (SFL)** and looking to defend his multiple titles in the coming season.

For a man who has won everything there is to win, the goal is no longer just trophies. It is legacy. And as 2025 comes to a close, Xiao Hai's legacy is undeniable: he is the Absolute King of Fighting Games.
