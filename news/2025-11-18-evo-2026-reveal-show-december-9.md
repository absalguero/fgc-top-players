The Fighting Game Community won't have to wait until the new year to find out what the future holds. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the **Evolution Championship Series (Evo)** announced a special "Announcement Show" scheduled for **December 9, 2025**.

Set to stream live at **5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET**, the broadcast promises to unveil the core details for **Evo 2026**, **Evo Japan 2026**, and the return of the **Evo Awards**.

## A New Era for Evo Dates

While specific game lineups are usually the headline, the biggest story going into 2026 is the calendar shift. During Evo 2025 in Las Vegas, General Manager Rick "The Hadou" Thiher dropped a bombshell: **Evo 2026 will take place in June**, moving away from its traditional July/August window.

* **Evo Japan 2026:** May 1–3, 2026
* **Evo Las Vegas 2026:** June 26–28, 2026

This schedule adjustment has already caused ripples in the FGC ecosystem, most notably forcing **CEO** organizer Alex Jebailey to shift his premier Florida tournament to August to avoid splitting the player base during the busy summer window. The December 9 show is expected to confirm venues (likely returning to the Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall) and potentially shed light on ticket registration windows.

## The Lineup: Who Makes the Cut?

The most anticipated segment of any Evo reveal is the main stage game roster. With the fighting game renaissance in full swing, competition for the main stage slots is fiercer than ever.

* **The Locks:** *Street Fighter 6* and *Tekken 8* are guaranteed headliners.
* **The New Mainstay:** Riot Games' **2XKO**, having launched earlier this year, is a prime candidate to secure a permanent home on the main stage. With its team-based mechanics and massive developer support, it is expected to draw one of the largest bracket counts of the weekend.
* **The Challengers:** SNK's **Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves** is fighting for its spot, while *Hunter x Hunter: Nen Impact* has garnered significant community interest.
* **Legacy Title:** After the massive success of *Marvel vs. Capcom 2* at Evo 2025, speculation is running wild about what "Throwback Game" will take center stage next. Could it be *Capcom vs. SNK 2*? *Power Stone*? Or perhaps a return to *Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike*?

## Global Expansion

Beyond Las Vegas and Japan, Evo continues to expand its global footprint. Following the confirmation of **Evo Singapore** earlier this year, fans are expecting concrete details regarding dates and the venue. Additionally, with **Evo France** already confirmed to return following its inaugural event in Nice, the community is looking for concrete dates and game lineup details to plan their European travel.
