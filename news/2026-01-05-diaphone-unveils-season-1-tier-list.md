## Hotaru Stands Alone

Weibo Gaming's Tyler "**Diaphone**" Kusich released his comprehensive evaluation of the Season 1 meta, offering a perspective that reinforces the consensus building in other regions. The defining feature of his list is the isolation of **Hotaru Futaba** in the "Best (S)" category.

While Hotaru has been a popular pick globally, Diaphone’s list suggests she has no equal when optimized. This placement values her oppressive pressure and mobility, creating a significant gap between her and the rest of the cast. Just below her, the "Great (A)" tier features **Kain R. Heinlein** and **Hokutomaru**, acknowledging their consistency and high ceilings without granting them the broken status of Hotaru.

## Global Meta Comparisons

Diaphone’s rankings provide a fascinating counter-narrative to the [Japanese Wall](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/japanese-pros-define-the-wall-in-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-tier-list/) and [Mexican Aggro](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/mexican-pros-challenge-japanese-meta-in-new-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-tier-list/) metas.

**Billy Kane: The Mid-Tier Consensus**
While early impressions suggested Billy Kane might be an impenetrable wall, Diaphone places him firmly in **B Tier (Good)**. This assessment actually aligns with the Japanese tier list, which also positions Billy in the mid-tier, debunking the idea that he is an overpowering zoner at the highest levels of play.

**Hokutomaru's Rise**
Diaphone identifies **Hokutomaru** as a premier threat, placing him in the A tier alongside Kain. This placement highlights the value of high-execution characters in the current meta. In Diaphone's estimation, the ninja's complex toolset offers win conditions that rival the best in the game, elevating him above the crowded mid-tier pack.

**The "Good" vs "Alright" Divide**
The list implies a significant power gap in the current meta, with only five characters in B Tier or higher. While **Marco Rodrigues** and **Billy Kane** round out this exclusive group of viable contenders, the vast majority of the cast falls into the C and D tiers. This heavy skew suggests that competitive options are severely limited, and players venturing outside the top five face a steep uphill battle against the current top threats.

## What’s Next

With the Season 1 meta solidified, the community now looks toward the release of **Season 2**. Players are hopeful that the upcoming update will bring necessary balance changes, specifically nerfs to the powerful top tiers like Hotaru, to level the playing field.
