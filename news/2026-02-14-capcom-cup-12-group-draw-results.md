## The Road to the Cup

The group draw has organized the 48 finalists into 12 distinct round-robin pools. The stakes are incredibly high from the outset as players must fight for seeding to avoid immediate elimination or the treacherous lower bracket. With the field set, here is the complete breakdown of every group.

### Group A: The New Standard
* **Xiaohai, Blaz, Hotdog29, Juicyjoe**

While Xiaohai is a legend of the genre, the momentum has shifted firmly toward Blaz. The Chilean competitor has been on a tear of late, recently defeating Xiaohai at GTW to cement his status as one of the world's premier threats. Xiaohai will need to adjust quickly to reclaim the top spot, while Hotdog29 and Juicyjoe look to disrupt the standings.

### Group B: The Group of Death
* **Kawano, Fuudo, Bravery, Endingwalker**

Widely considered the toughest bracket of the tournament, Group B is a nightmare scenario for its inhabitants. It pits the terrifying precision of Kawano against the immaculate fundamentals of Fuudo. Adding to the volatility is the UK’s Endingwalker, whose creative offensive pressure can overwhelm even the most disciplined defenders. Bravery faces an uphill battle in this shark tank of premier talent.

### Group C: Chasing the Third Ring
* **Menard, YHC-Mochi, Dakcorgi, Big Bird**

All eyes are on Menard, the only player in history to lift the Capcom Cup twice. His path to a potential third title is far from easy as he must contend with Big Bird, a powerhouse from the Middle East capable of winning the entire tournament on a good day. The group also features the unorthodox Dhalsim play of YHC-Mochi, which serves as a dangerous knowledge check for everyone in the pool.

### Group D: Battle of Consistency
* **NL, Sahara, Shaka, Jabhim**

Korea’s NL has built a reputation as one of the most consistent players in the world, rarely missing a Top 8. He anchors a group that features dangerous regional talents. Sahara and Shaka will look to disrupt NL’s structured game plan, making this one of the harder groups to predict outside of the top seed.

### Group E: Regional Warfare
* **Dual Kevin, Pugera, Caba, Yonangel**

This pool offers a fascinating clash of regional metas. North America’s Dual Kevin brings his explosive Rashid to the table, while Caba represents the Dominican Republic’s high-energy playstyle. Japan's Pugera adds a layer of technical execution that will test the patience of his opponents.

### Group F: The Bird and The Genius
* **AngryBird, Momochi, Tashi, Kincho**

A heavyweight collision defines Group F, as AngryBird squares off against the veteran tactician Momochi. Both players are known for their deep understanding of the game engine, making their head-to-head match a potential preview of the Grand Finals. Tashi and Kincho will need to capitalize on any hesitation from these two titans to steal a spot.

### Group G: Technical Mastery
* **Gachikun, Kobayan, NotPedro, Vxbao**

Group G is a showcase of character specialists. Gachikun remains the standard-bearer for Rashid, but the group’s X-factor is Kobayan, whose Zangief has terrorized the Japanese scene. Vxbao brings elite execution from China, creating a volatile mix where one wrong guess against Kobayan could cost any of these technical masters the set.

### Group H: The World Number One
* **Leshar, Ryukichi, Lugabo, Travis Styles**

Leshar stunned the world with his performance at the previous Capcom Cup, proving that his fundamental understanding of *Street Fighter 6* is second to none. He enters this tournament ranked as the #1 player in the world on our site, making him the heavy favorite to exit this group in first place. Ryukichi and Lugabo will have to play perfect games to unseat the current king.

### Group I: The Rematch
* **Punk, Xerna, Armakof, Higuchi**

This group highlights a compelling stylistic clash between Punk and Higuchi. Their previous encounters have been chess matches, with Higuchi’s patient Guile often frustrating Punk’s spacing-heavy neutral game. With Punk currently in top form, this rematch will likely determine the winner of the pool.

### Group J: The Clear Favorite
* **Micky, Lexx, Chris Tatarian, Rainpro**

On paper, this is Micky's group to lose. He enters the bracket ranked 20th in the world on our leaderboards, a massive statistical advantage given that no other player in this pool currently cracks the top 75. While Chris Tatarian brings veteran experience, the data suggests Micky should have a relatively smooth path to the winners side.

### Group K: Hinao's Challenge
* **Hinao, Kilzyou, Nuckledu, iiiraihaniii**

Hinao enters Group K as the formidable favorite, bringing a level of consistency and power that makes him the player to beat in this bracket. The race for the second spot is likely a dead heat between former Capcom Cup champion Nuckledu and the rising European talent Kilzyou. Both players are evenly matched in terms of skill ceiling, meaning their head-to-head encounter could decide who advances alongside Hinao.

### Group L: The Grappler's Den
* **Itabashi Zangief, Deiver, Jak, Jiewa**

Fan-favorite Itabashi Zangief brings his trademark heavy reads to Group L. He will be tested by Jak, a formidable competitor from the US known for his Juri. The presence of Jiewa adds veteran savvy to the mix, ensuring that Itazan will have to work hard for every command grab.

## The Countdown Begins

With the groups finalized, the countdown to Tokyo begins. The mix of established legends like Momochi and Menard clashing with top-ranked contenders like Leshar and Micky promises one of the most unpredictable Capcom Cups in history. The action kicks off next month, where every match will determine who survives the group stage and who goes home empty-handed.
