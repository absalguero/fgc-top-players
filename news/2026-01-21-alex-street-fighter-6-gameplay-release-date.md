**Street Fighter 6** developers have officially confirmed the release date and technical specifications for Alex, following up on the initial teaser reveal with a deep dive into his mechanics. The New York grappler will join the roster on March 17. He arrives with a fundamental change that separates this iteration from his *Street Fighter III* and *V* counterparts: the complete removal of charge inputs.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **March 17 Launch:** The character is confirmed for release in roughly two months.
* **Motion Inputs Only:** Alex has abandoned his traditional charge mechanics for standard motion inputs.
* **Stance Heavy:** The new "Prowler Stance" creates a high-risk mixup game by offering 11 distinct follow-ups while disabling blocking.

## Charge Partitioning is Gone

While the previous teaser gave fans a glimpse of Alex's updated visual design, Capcom's latest update clarifies exactly how he will control. In a significant departure for the character, who has historically been a hybrid charge/motion character, his *Street Fighter 6* iteration relies entirely on motion inputs.

This change is designed to increase his offensive fluidity. It allows players to walk forward and threaten space without needing to hold down-back to charge special moves. This adjustment aligns with the generally more aggressive meta of *Street Fighter 6*, though it may require muscle memory adjustments for character loyalists.

## Details & Information

The technical breakdown released regarding his kit highlights a character built around "Prowler Stance" and variable command grabs.

### The Prowler Stance
This new mechanic appears to be the core of Alex's pressure game. Entering the stance prevents Alex from blocking, leaving him open to punishes if timed poorly. However, it unlocks 11 different options to turn him into a walking mixup machine.
* **Heavy Punch:** Unleashes "Heavy Lariat," which is plus on block. If the button is held, the move gains armor properties.
* **Light Kick:** Performs "Tactical Hop" to close distance or bait throws.
* **Medium Kick:** "Air Stampede" (stomp) returns as a stance follow-up.

### Command Grab Nuances
Alex’s signature "Power Bomb" has been tuned with specific properties based on button strength. The Light version offers the longest range but slowest startup. Conversely, the Heavy version is fast with poor range.

A new mechanic allows the Power Bomb to shift into a "Power Drop" if the opponent is back-turned. This variation deals increased damage and forces a side switch. This gives Alex better corner carry potential.

### Frame Data Notes
Capcom noted that "Flash Chop" (Heavy Punch version) leaves Alex plus on block. This will likely serve as his primary frame trap tool. His anti-air game relies on "Aerial Knee Smash," which remains a consistent option for checking jump-ins.

## What’s Next

With the release date set for March 17, the community now waits for the full patch notes that usually accompany a character release. Players looking to main Alex should prepare to practice "Prowler Stance" setups. The lack of blocking capabilities during the stance will likely make it a high-execution knowledge check in the early meta.
