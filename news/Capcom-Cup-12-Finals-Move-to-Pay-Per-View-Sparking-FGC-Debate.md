In a landmark shift for fighting game esports, Capcom has announced that the Capcom Cup 12 Finals will be broadcast as a pay-per-view (PPV) event. The controversial decision places the tournament’s Top 16 finals bracket, scheduled for March 14, 2026, behind a paywall — breaking from the long-standing tradition of free access for its premier Street Fighter tournament.

The event, which features a $1,282,000 prize pool with $1 million for the champion, will be held at Tokyo’s Ryōgoku Kokugikan. While the early stages of the 48-player tournament from March 11–13 will remain free to watch, the climax of the competition will require a paid ticket.

## A New Model: Pricing and Access

Capcom has outlined a clear pricing structure for fans who want to watch the finals live. Access to the main event will be sold in two tiers, with ticket sales launching on November 12, 2025, through official Capcom channels.  
- A single-day PPV ticket for the Capcom Cup 12 Finals is priced at ¥4,000 (approximately $26.75 USD).  
- A bundle ticket that includes the Street Fighter League World Championship is available for ¥6,000 (around $40.13 USD).  

For those who miss the live broadcast, free replays of the matches (without commentary) will be uploaded on March 21.

## Community Backlash and Industry Precedent

The announcement was met with immediate and widespread backlash from the fighting game community (FGC). Many fans and players argue that the PPV model undermines the grassroots accessibility that has been crucial to the FGC’s growth. Prominent professional player **Adel “Big Bird” Anouche** called it a “surprising and weird decision,” expressing that he doesn’t believe this is the right approach — a sentiment he shared directly on social media.

The move is widely seen as a dangerous precedent that could lead other major tournaments, such as EVO or the Tekken World Tour, to adopt similar paid models.

## Capcom's High-Stakes Gamble

From a business perspective, Capcom's decision appears to be an attempt to leverage the massive success of *Street Fighter 6* to create a new, direct revenue stream. However, the strategy carries significant risks. Alienating a global fanbase could erode the goodwill Capcom has built over years of free broadcasts and may lead to lower live viewership, potentially diminishing the event’s value for sponsors.

As the event approaches, the key questions remain: will community pressure lead Capcom to adjust its model, and how will this experiment shape the future of FGC broadcasts?
