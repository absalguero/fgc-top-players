## Lugabo Joins 2Game Esports

2Game Esports announced the acquisition of **Lugabo** on Thursday evening. The signing brings the 16-year-old phenom into the fold just weeks before he is set to compete at Capcom Cup 12. Lugabo dominated the highly competitive Mexico region during the 2025 season, culminating in a victory at the World Warrior Regional Final that punched his ticket to the season's grand finale.

The organization highlighted Lugabo's youth and potential in their official statement, noting that he "arrives to add up" to their growing legacy. By securing a fourth Capcom Cup qualified player, 2Game has positioned itself as perhaps the best-represented organization at the upcoming world championship.

## A Continental Powerhouse

The addition of Lugabo solidifies 2Game Esports as the premier destination for Latin American talent. The organization has effectively built a continental superteam that bridges the Portuguese and Spanish-speaking communities of the Americas.

Lugabo (Mexico) joins a formidable lineup of qualified teammates:
* **Blaz** (Chile): The veteran competitor who has become a staple of the global scene.
* **Shaka** (Argentina): The Dhalsim specialist who recently joined the squad.
* **Tashi** (Venezuela): Another rising star who secured his qualification via the Central America West region.

This recruitment strategy balances veteran experience with explosive new talent, ensuring 2Game has multiple viable paths to the title while representing the full breadth of the Latin American scene.
