## The Field is Set for Capcom Cup 12

The 2025 Capcom Pro Tour season has reached its conclusion. After a grueling year of Premier events, World Warrior qualifiers, and the Esports World Cup, the field of 48 is set. The roster was officially completed following the World Warrior Japan Regional Final, the last qualifying event on the calendar.

Leading the charge is **MenaRD**, who captured the world's attention by winning Evo Japan 2025. He is joined by **Xiao Hai**, the fighting game legend who added a *Street Fighter 6* major to his resume by dominating the Esports World Cup 2025. The total prize pool for the season exceeds $2 million, with the ultimate champion of Capcom Cup 12 taking home a life-changing $1 million check.

### Kakeru Steps Down
In a significant shakeup to the bracket, defending Capcom Cup 11 champion **Kakeru** announced his withdrawal from the tournament [citing an ongoing neurological disorder](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/kakeru-steps-down-from-zeta-division-retires-from-competition-citing-neurological-disorder/). As per CPT regulations, his qualification spot was transferred to the next eligible player from the previous cup not already qualified. This allowed **AngryBird**, a perennial favorite, to rejoin the fray.

## What's Next: The Group Draw

With the roster now complete, all eyes turn to the group stage draw. The sheer density of killers in this bracket means there will be no "easy" pools. **Punk**, who topped the Global Leaderboard, will be looking to finally capture the Capcom Cup trophy that has eluded him in past grand finals.

Capcom has confirmed that the official Group Stage Draw will take place on **February 15** [via the official broadcast channels](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/capcom-cup-12-and-sfl-world-championship-draw-set-for-february-15/).
