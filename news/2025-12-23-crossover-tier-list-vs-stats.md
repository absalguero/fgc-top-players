**Street Fighter 6 Tier Lists** often reveal the gap between theoretical strength and practical results, and **CrossoverRD**'s latest ranking offers a fascinating case study. The Dominican pro's new list aligns perfectly with our site's data on top-tier staples like **Ed** and **Ryu** (S-Tier) and the balanced nature of **Elena** (B-Tier). However, it takes a bold stance on **Sagat**, placing him in S-Tier, a decision likely influenced by specific high-level performances that defy the broader statistical trends.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **The Sagat Split:** CrossoverRD places the "King of Muay Thai" in **S-Tier**, contrasting with our **CPV (Character Performance Viability)** data which currently ranks him in **D-Tier**.
* **The Blaz Factor:** The high ranking likely mirrors the success of players like **Blaz**, who has utilized Sagat effectively in the *Street Fighter League (SFL)*.
* **Specialists vs General Population:** The discrepancy highlights how a single specialist like Blaz can elevate a character's perceived viability well above what our **CPV** metrics track for the general competitive population.

## Where They Agree: The Shoto Dominance & Elena

For the first time in Season 3, a major pro tier list and our algorithmic data are largely in sync regarding the meta's ceiling. Both CrossoverRD and our statistical model identify **Ed**, **Ryu**, **Mai**, and **Akuma** as S-Tier powerhouses. The data validates the community sentiment that Ryu's damage buffs have solidified his place in the upper echelon, with a massive **72.01** CPV on our index.

Crucially, the two sources also find common ground on the newly released **Elena**. While often hyped by casual fans for her "Healing" mechanic, both CrossoverRD and our stats place her in **B-Tier**. Her current CPV of **31.16** reflects a character that is solid but lacks the overwhelming oppression of the true S-Tier giants.

## The Sagat Anomaly: Blaz vs The Field

The most interesting conversation point is **Sagat**. CrossoverRD includes him in the elite S-Tier, a sentiment that might confuse players looking at global win rates. On our site, Sagat sits in **D-Tier** with a CPV of **5.13**, indicating he struggles to consistently top 8 in open-bracket double-elimination tournaments.

However, statistics often miss context. As noted in our recent coverage of the [Street Fighter League US playoffs](/news/bandits-dominates-sfl-us-regular-season-playoff-bracket-set/), **Blaz** (playing for 2Game Esports) has been a standout performer with Sagat. When a player of that caliber pilots the character, they can make Sagat look impenetrable. CrossoverRD appears to be valuing this specific high-level efficacy, whereas our CPV data reflects the harsh reality that, outside of Blaz, the character rarely sees deep tournament runs.

## Statistical Breakdown

The following table compares CrossoverRD's "Pro Sentiment" against our "Hard Data" CPV metrics.

<div class="table-wrapper m-auto max-w-90ch" style="margin-bottom: 40px; overflow-x: auto;">
  <table class="data-table" style="min-width: 100%;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Character</th>
        <th>CrossoverRD Tier</th>
        <th>Our CPV Tier</th>
        <th>Verdict</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td><strong>Ryu</strong></td><td>S Tier</td><td>S Tier (72.01)</td><td><strong>Agreed.</strong> High damage output is dominating the meta.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Sagat</strong></td><td>S Tier</td><td>D Tier (5.13)</td><td><strong>Context Dependent.</strong> S-Tier in the hands of Blaz, but low win rate globally.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Elena</strong></td><td>B Tier</td><td>B Tier (31.16)</td><td><strong>Agreed.</strong> A balanced character that is not broken.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Terry</strong></td><td>S Tier</td><td>B Tier (33.82)</td><td><strong>Overrated?</strong> Stats show he is a solid mid-tier, not a tournament sweeper.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Jamie</strong></td><td>B Tier</td><td>D Tier (0.00)</td><td><strong>Ladder Struggle.</strong> Remains one of the hardest characters to win with consistently.</td></tr>

## What’s Next

As we head into the final stretch of the **Capcom Cup** qualifiers, the question remains: Can other players replicate the success **Blaz** has found with Sagat? If so, our CPV stats will rise to meet CrossoverRD's prediction. Until then, Sagat remains a terrifying *specialist* pick rather than a global meta dominator.
