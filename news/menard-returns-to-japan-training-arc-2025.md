Most players would take a break after leading their team to a flawless undefeated record halfway through the season. **Saul "MenaRD" Mena** is not most players.

In a recent announcement that has put the competitive *Street Fighter 6* scene on notice, the reigning **Evo Vegas** and **Evo Japan** champion announced he is returning to **Japan** for another intensive training arc. His goal is to ensure he is absolutely untouchable for the remainder of the **Street Fighter League (SFL)** and the upcoming **Capcom Cup**.

## "My Training Is Not Over"

MenaRD's announcement comes amidst a historic run for his team, **Bandits**. Currently sitting at the top of the SFL US leaderboard with a **6-0 record** and **190 points**, Bandits has looked virtually unstoppable. Mena himself has been a dominant force, losing only a single individual set (to Team Falcons' NL) while anchoring his squad to victory after victory.

Yet, satisfaction is the enemy of the great. In his statement, MenaRD revealed that he does not feel "strong enough" yet to guarantee the championship.

> *"I still feel like my training isn't over yet, so I've decided to return to Japan... Until I can truly feel that I've become strong enough, I won't board a flight to California."*

## Why Japan?

This is not MenaRD's first pilgrimage to the mecca of fighting games. His previous extended stays in Japan have been catalysts for major level-ups, leading to his historic "Grand Slam" victory at **Evo Japan 2025** and **Evo Vegas 2025** earlier this year. The Japanese region is currently home to some of the densest competition in the world, with players like **Kakeru**, **Gachikun**, and **Kawano** constantly pushing the meta.

By immersing himself in this environment, MenaRD is likely looking to sharpen his **Blanka** against the specific defensive styles that Japanese players excel at, ensuring that when he returns to the US for the SFL playoffs, he will be playing a different game than everyone else.

## The Bandits Ecosystem

While Mena sharpens his claws overseas, his team remains in good hands. The Bandits roster for this season (featuring the defensive wall **Caba**, the veteran **Chris Tatarian**, and the rising star **Booce**) has proven they can hold their own. However, having their captain return with new strategies from the world's strongest region could be the decisive factor that secures them the World Championship rings.
