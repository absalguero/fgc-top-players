**Phenom has released his latest "Ordered" SF6 Tier List**, presenting a snapshot of the current meta that closely tracks with global performance data.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Statistical Synergy:** Phenom’s S-Tier (Ed, Mai, Ryu) aligns almost perfectly with the current top Competitive Performance Viability (CPV) ratings.
* **Ryu's Dominance:** The list reinforces Ryu's position as a premier threat, matching his impressive global metrics.
* **Ken's Status Quo:** Phenom keeps Ken in B+, maintaining the stance that the former top-tier has settled firmly into the mid-range.

## Validating the Numbers
Norwegian fighting game veteran Phenom (Arman Hanjani) released his latest "Ordered" tier list, and the results serve as high-level validation of the trends currently dominating the *Street Fighter 6* landscape.

The most obvious alignment is at the summit. Phenom places **Ed** and **Mai Shiranui** at the very top of S-Tier. This mirrors the aggregate site data, where Ed holds the dominant #1 spot with a CPV of 99.99, and Mai sits comfortably at #3.

Furthermore, Phenom places **Ryu** firmly in S-Tier (4th position). Both Phenom’s assessment and the hard data (Rank #2, CPV 71.87) confirm that the flagship shoto has evolved into one of the game's most efficient winners.

This consistency highlights that Phenom’s assessments are not momentary reactions but a recognition of a settled meta, where characters like Ed and Mai have firmly established their dominance over the long term.

## Divergences: Luke and Jamie
While the list largely correlates with global CPV, there are nuances where Phenom’s pro experience differs from the raw averages:

1.  **Luke:** Statistically, Luke has seen better days, dropping to **C-Tier (Rank #22)** with a CPV of 26.45. Phenom, however, maintains Luke in **A+**, suggesting that while the character's general consistency has dropped, his toolkit remains viable in expert hands.
2.  **Jamie:** The data places Jamie at the bottom of the roster (**D-Tier**), yet Phenom ranks him in **A (Ordered)**. This indicates Phenom sees potential in the Drunken Boxer that is not currently being realized by the general player base.
