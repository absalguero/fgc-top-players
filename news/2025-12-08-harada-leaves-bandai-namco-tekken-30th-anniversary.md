Katsuhiro Harada, the long serving General Manager and face of the Tekken franchise, has announced he will leave Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. The announcement coincides with the 30th anniversary of the Tekken series, a timing Harada described as the most fitting moment to bring this chapter of his career to a close.

## A Legacy Rooted in Arcades and Tournaments
Harada emphasized that his origins as a developer are deeply connected to the fighting game community and the arcade scene. In his statement, he recalled the days when he supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and community centers overseas. He described physically carrying arcade cabinets himself and encouraging people to try the game. He noted that the conversations and atmosphere shared in those venues became the core of his identity as a creator, a sentiment that remained even as the Tekken World Tour expanded into a global phenomenon.

## Reasons for Departure and Future Plans
The decision to leave follows a period of reflection regarding his remaining time as a creator. Harada cited the recent loss of close friends and the passing of respected senior colleagues as catalysts for this change. He also revealed that he sought advice from Ken Kutaragi, the former Sony executive often called the Father of PlayStation, whose guidance supported his decision.

Harada assured fans that the future of Tekken is secure. Over the past few years, he has gradually transferred his responsibilities, including story and worldbuilding, to the development team. While he officially departs at the end of the year, Bandai Namco has invited him to attend the Tekken World Tour Finals in Malmö, Sweden, in late January 2026 as a guest. To celebrate the transition, he also released a personal DJ mix titled "TEKKEN: A 30-Year Journey" for the community. The community now looks to Malmö to give the Tekken chief the send-off he deserves.
