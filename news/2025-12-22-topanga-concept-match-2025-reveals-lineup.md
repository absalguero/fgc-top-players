## Topanga Concept Match: Asia Special - Full Details

The prestigious Topanga Concept Match returns this winter with a special international twist. Dubbed the "Asia Special," the event pits five of Japan's most storied *Street Fighter 6* competitors against an "Asia All-Stars" squad featuring top talent from South Korea, China, and Taiwan.

Taking place at the RED° TOKYO TOWER, the event continues Topanga's tradition of long-set formats. Each matchup will be a First-to-7 (FT7) series. This format serves as a grueling test of adaptation and mental fortitude compared to the standard First-to-2 tournament format.

The ruleset explicitly forbids a "Deuce" scenario. Unlike formats where a player must win by a margin of two games to close out a set, this event is a strict race to the finish line. The first competitor to secure 7 wins is declared the winner immediately, regardless of how close the final score is.

Additional rules include:
* **Win Condition:** First player to reach 7 wins.
* **Character Lock:** The loser of a game may switch characters. The winner must keep their character.

## Match Card & Schedule

The card features five distinct head-to-head matchups. While the event is marketed as a team battle, each set is an individual FT7 showdown. 

Notable clashes include **Tokido** facing off against Taiwan's **Oil King**, who has recently added a dangerous Terry to his arsenal. The finale features **Mago** taking on the current #1 ranked player on FGC Top Players: breakout star **LeShar** from South Korea.
