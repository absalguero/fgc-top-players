## Topanga Concept Match: Asia Special - Full Details

The prestigious Topanga Concept Match returned this winter with a special international twist. Dubbed the "Asia Special," the event pitted five of Japan's most storied *Street Fighter 6* competitors against an "Asia All-Stars" squad featuring top talent from South Korea, China, and Taiwan.

Taking place at the RED° TOKYO TOWER, the event continued Topanga's tradition of long-set formats. Each matchup was a First-to-7 (FT7) series. This format served as a grueling test of adaptation and mental fortitude compared to the standard First-to-2 tournament format.

The ruleset explicitly forbade a "Deuce" scenario. Unlike formats where a player must win by a margin of two games to close out a set, this event was a strict race to the finish line.

Additional rules included:
* **Win Condition:** First player to reach 7 wins.
* **Character Lock:** The loser of a game could switch characters. The winner had to keep their character.

## Match Results & Schedule

The card featured five distinct head-to-head matchups. While the event was marketed as a team battle, each set was an individual FT7 showdown.

Notable results included **Tokido** securing a solid win against Taiwan's **Oil King**, while the finale saw **LeShar** dominate **Mago** with a convincing 7-1 scoreline. The closest set of the night was **Fuudo** vs **Vxbao**, which went the distance to the final game.
