## The Road to the Grand Finals Starts at Frosty Faustings
SNK Corporation has revealed that the **SNK World Championship 2026 (SWC 2026)** will begin its global search for the world’s best players at [Frosty Faustings XVIII](http://localhost:8080/upcoming-tournaments/frosty-faustings-xviii-2026/) in January. This circuit represents the next high-stakes evolution for *FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves*, which has been allotted 32 dedicated slots for its Grand Finals bracket.

The qualifying structure utilizes a hybrid of offline majors and regional online tournaments. According to the official [SWC 2026 Rulebook](https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/swc2026/rulebook_ver1_eng.pdf), the circuit will feature a points-based ranking system where placements determine a player's standing. In a move that significantly raises the stakes for every bracket run, SNK will convert all earned points into prize money at the end of the season, ensuring that top-tier consistency is rewarded regardless of Grand Final qualification.

## Tournament Titles & Regional Breakdown
While *City of the Wolves* and *Art of Fighting 3* details are confirmed, SNK noted that the total slot counts for veteran titles *KOF XV* and *Samurai Shodown* will be finalized at a later date. 

For *City of the Wolves*, online qualifiers will be split across nine global regions: North America, Central/South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and South Asia. Winners of these specific regional events will earn direct slots, while others will fight for the "Point Ranking" positions. 

Notably, the inclusion of *ART OF FIGHTING 3: The Path of the Warrior* as an **Open Tournament** provides a unique opportunity for attendees. Unlike the other titles which require grueling seasonal travel or online consistency, the "Open" format allows any player physically present at the Grand Finals venue to register and compete directly for the world title.
