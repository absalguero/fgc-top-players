excerpt: "Fresh off an SFL US Championship with Bandits, MenaRD announces he is open to offers. This sparks rumors of a move to Street Fighter League Japan."
---

Days after cementing his legacy with a historic Street Fighter League (SFL) US Championship, Saul "MenaRD" Mena has captured the attention of the Fighting Game Community. The Dominican powerhouse and multi-time Capcom Cup champion posted yesterday that he is officially open to SFL offers for the upcoming season. This signals a potential departure from the US region he has thoroughly dominated.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **MenaRD is officially open to offers** for the next Street Fighter League season.
* **Speculation is high** that Mena is targeting SFL Japan to challenge the world's strongest region.
* **A potential exit** leaves the SFL US throne wide open for teams like FlyQuest and 2GAME.

## MenaRD Eyes Global Options After SFL US Dominance
For the casual observer, MenaRD's announcement might look like standard offseason business. Yet for those following his trajectory, the timing implies something far more ambitious than a simple contract renegotiation. After [defeating FlyQuest in the SFL US Championship](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/bandits-stops-flyquest-to-win-sfl-us-championship/), Mena appears ready for a new stage. All signs point to **SFL Japan**.

To understand why a move is likely, one must look at what remains for MenaRD to prove in the West. Leading Bandits, he orchestrated one of the most oppressive seasons in SFL history. As we saw during their [record-breaking regular season](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/bandits-dominates-sfl-us-regular-season-playoff-bracket-set/), the team did not just win. They suffocated the opposition. They capped off a season where they looked virtually untouchable.

## A Power Shift in the Street Fighter 6 Meta
Competing in SFL Japan would not just be a roster move. It would be the ultimate challenge. Mena has frequently cited the Japanese training environment as key to his peak performance. We previously covered his [return to Japan](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/no-days-off-grand-slam-champ-menard-returns-to-japan-to-unlock-final-boss-form/) to unlock his "Final Boss" form. This move paid dividends with his EVO Japan titles. A move to a Japanese team would force local squads to bid for his services or face the world's premier Blanka player on a weekly basis.

For the US, it opens a significant power vacuum. With the Bandits' captain potentially exiting, the region becomes a free-for-all. Below are the final standings of the season Mena just conquered. This highlights the gap he leaves behind:

## Looking Ahead
The "Open for offers" sign is up. We now wait to see which organization is brave enough to make the call. The rosters for the 2026 season are expected to be finalized in the coming weeks.
