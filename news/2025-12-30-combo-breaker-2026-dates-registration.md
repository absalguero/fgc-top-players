## The Midwest's Premier Event Returns

Combo Breaker 2026 will once again take over the Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center in Schaumburg, Illinois. Organizers confirmed the May 22–24 dates today, marking the event's continued tradition of anchoring the North American fighting game calendar during Memorial Day Weekend.

Registration for the event is now open on [start.gg](https://www.start.gg/tournament/combo-breaker-2026/details). The event has set an attendance cap of 8,500 attendees for 2026, encouraging players to register early. The "Early Bird" registration window begins today, offering a discounted rate for competitors and spectators who commit early.
