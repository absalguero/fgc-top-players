## Precision Meets Performance
Qanba USA continues to expand its roster of elite talent by signing Micky (Chan Pak-yin), one of the most technically gifted players in the *Street Fighter 6* ecosystem. The announcement emphasizes Micky's need for absolute precision, a requirement met by the specific design of the Sapphire Leverless.

Micky has been a breakout star in the *Street Fighter 6* era, securing a stunning 3rd place finish at EVO 2025 after eliminating veterans like Fuudo and Phenom in the loser's bracket. Known for his "frame-perfect play" with Mai, Micky's switch to a leverless architecture optimizes his execution, offering faster inputs for reaction-heavy situations like anti-airs and instant aerial approaches.

## The Hardware Advantage
The **Qanba Sapphire** is uniquely suited for a technical specialist like Micky. Unlike traditional arcade sticks, the Sapphire features an 18-button layout designed to offer players more options for input shortcuts and tournament-legal SOCD (Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions) cleaning strategies.

For a character like Mai, where execution drops can cost a round, the Sapphire’s Cherry MX switches and adjustable button throw distance allow for nearly instant activation. The controller also features a tournament lock switch to prevent accidental pauses, a critical feature for high-stakes matches on the Capcom Pro Tour. By adopting this hardware, Micky secures a toolset built specifically for the speed of modern fighting games.

## What’s Next
Fans can expect to see Micky sporting the Qanba colors and the Sapphire controller in upcoming brackets. With the 2026 competitive circuit on the horizon, this sponsorship ensures the Hong Kong star has the backing to make another deep run at a world title.
