## The Road to the Grand Finals begins Saturday

The regular season has concluded and the matchups are locked for the **Street Fighter League: Pro-JP 2025 Playoffs**. Following months of intense competition in *Street Fighter 6*, the field has been whittled down to the top three teams from both Division S and Division F.

The action begins on **Saturday, December 13** with the semifinal matches. In Division S, the surprise powerhouse **Nagoya OJA BODY STAR** will defend their home advantage against the star studded **Crazy Raccoon**. Nagoya OJA is led by the season's breakout star, KEI.B, who [dominated the regular season](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/keib-dominates-sfl-japan-2025-the-mai-mastermind-behind-nagoya-ojas-rise/) with a league high 140 points. His mastery of Mai Shiranui has been a nightmare for opponents, but he faces a steep test against a Crazy Raccoon squad featuring veteran killers like **Dogura, Shuto, Kazunoko, and Bonchan**.

In Division F, **Team iXA** will square off against **ZETA DIVISION**. Team iXA’s roster of **ACQUA, Hibiki, Akira, and Adelie** narrowly missed the top spot in their division and will look to leverage their consistency against a ZETA squad anchored by the legendary **Momochi**. ZETA will be fighting with their adjusted roster after **Yamaguchi** stepped in to replace [Kakeru, who retired earlier this season](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/kakeru-steps-down-from-zeta-division-retires-from-competition-citing-neurological-disorder/) due to health issues.

> **"Our team is strong. I won't know until it actually starts, but at this stage, I think we might be the strongest."**

## Division Finals and Broadcast Details

The stakes raise even higher on **Sunday, December 14** when the winners of Saturday's bouts advance to face the division leaders.

In Division S, the defending champions **Good 8 Squad** (**Gachikun, Kawano, Pugera, and Sahara**) are waiting in the wings. Having secured first place with 300 points, they sit just one match away from returning to the Grand Final.

Over in Division F, **Yogibo REJECT** (**Tokido, LeShar, Daigo, and Fuudo**) holds the top seed. REJECT’s "dream team" dominance in the regular season secured them the bye and they will face the survivor of the iXA vs. ZETA clash.

The winners of Sunday's Division Finals will officially qualify for the **SFL Pro-JP 2025 Grand Final** event scheduled for January 31, 2026.

Fans can catch all the playoff action live on the official [Capcom Fighters YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@CapcomFighters) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/capcomfighters) channels starting at **15:45 JST** on both days.
