**Street Fighter 6 Season 3** has received a controversial meta analysis from UK pro Broski, confirming a massive split between professional opinion and the Competitive Performance Viability (CPV) metrics regarding JP’s dominance.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **The JP Discrepancy:** Broski ranks JP as the absolute best character in the game, clashing with CPV data that places him in A-Tier, significantly trailing the statistical leader, Ed.
* **Ryu’s Raw Power:** Both Broski and the data agree on Ryu’s S-Tier status, with Broski noting the shoto now deals Marisa-level damage without the risks.
* **Bottom Tier Debate:** While Broski insists Lily is the undisputed worst character, the CPV metrics actually rank Jamie and Marisa lower.

## Broski vs. The Data: The JP Split

In his recent breakdown, Broski argued that JP remains the undisputed king of *Street Fighter 6*. He cited the character's "infinite" ceiling and lack of bad matchups as justification for the top spot. However, this opinion conflicts with current CPV stats.

While the data validates that JP is a formidable threat, sitting at the very top of A-Tier with a rating of 46.65 and hovering on the cusp of S-Tier, he is not the statistical king. That title currently belongs to Ed (99.99), who holds a massive lead over the rest of the cast in tournament viability. Broski’s placement of JP as the undisputed number one ignores this statistical gap, favoring theoretical potential over current results.

> **"I think JP's ceiling is basically infinite right... This character just keeps getting better and better as more time is passing. He doesn't really have any weaknesses."**
> — *Broski, Content Creator & Pro Player*

## Consensus on Ryu’s Dominance

One area where Broski’s "feel" aligns perfectly with the numbers is the resurgence of Ryu. The tournament data currently ranks Ryu as the second-best character in the game (71.62 CPV), firmly in S-Tier. Broski validated this statistical surge by highlighting how Capcom has buffed Ryu into a damage monster.

> **"Ryu now hits idiotically hard... He now has the same amount of damage as like Marisa but with none of the downsides that you need usually with a character like that."**
> — *Broski, Content Creator & Pro Player*

This alignment suggests that Ryu’s high win rates are not a fluke. The CPV data confirms he is one of the most viable high-damage characters in the current meta.

## Luke: Theory vs. Reality

Broski’s assessment of Luke matches the downward trend seen in the CPV rankings. Once the face of the game, Luke now sits in C-Tier on the viability charts with a CPV of 28.33. Broski attributes this to balance changes that stripped Luke of his unique strengths without applying the same standard to the rest of the cast.

> **"They completely normalized his kit but then didn't apply any of those normalizations to anyone else... It just made him kind of pointless."**
> — *Broski, Content Creator & Pro Player*

## Comparison: Broski vs. CPV Metrics

The following table highlights the major disagreements between Broski’s expert opinion and the current aggregate CPV data. While placing JP in S-Tier is not statistically far-fetched given his high rating, declaring him the singular best character contradicts the dominance of Ed and Ryu.

<div class="table-wrapper m-auto max-w-90ch" style="margin-bottom: 40px; overflow-x: auto;">
  <table class="data-table" style="min-width: 100%;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Character</th>
        <th>Broski's Rank</th>
        <th>CPV Data Rank</th>
        <th>Verdict</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>JP</td><td>#1 (S-Tier)</td><td>High A-Tier (46.65)</td><td>Disagreement (Rank #1 vs Rank #6)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Ed</td><td>#3 (S-Tier)</td><td>#1 (S-Tier)</td><td>Agreed (S-Tier)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Ryu</td><td>S-Tier</td><td>S-Tier (71.62)</td><td>Agreed</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Luke</td><td>C-Tier</td><td>C-Tier (28.33)</td><td>Agreed</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Lily</td><td>Bottom 1</td><td>D-Tier (9.92)</td><td> Slight Disagreement</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The disagreement regarding Lily is notable. Broski identifies her as the single worst character due to the effort required to win. However, the CPV data shows that Jamie (0.00) and Marisa (1.19) currently perform worse in competitive settings than Lily (9.92).

> **"It's just insane to me how many hoops this character has to jump through just to be plus one when like these characters can just sneeze on the controller and get the same advantage."**
> — *Broski, Content Creator & Pro Player*

## What’s Next

As the season progresses, players will be watching to see if the CPV ratings eventually catch up to Broski's prediction of JP's dominance. Meanwhile, the community waits to see if Capcom will address the "infinite ceiling" Broski warns about, or if the data proving Ed's statistical supremacy will lead to nerfs for the erratic boxer instead.
