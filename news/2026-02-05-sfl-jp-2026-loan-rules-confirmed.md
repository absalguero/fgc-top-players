**Street Fighter League: Pro-JP 2026** has released its comprehensive regulation set for the upcoming season, officially codifying the previously teased age limit changes while introducing aggressive new restrictions on player loans and roster construction.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Loan Cap:** Teams are now strictly limited to registering only **one** "Signed Free Agent" (borrowed player) per season.
* **Priority on Home Talent:** Organizations are prohibited from loaning players to other teams unless they have first secured four signed players of their own.
* **Age Limit Details:** The drop to a **15-year-old minimum** is officially ratified for domestic players, while international imports must still meet the age of majority in their home regions.

## The "Player Rental" Crackdown

While the [announcement of **Street Fighter League: Pro-Asia** for 2027](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/capcom-to-launch-street-fighter-league-pro-asia-in-2027/) grabbed headlines earlier this week, the newly released bylaws for the 2026 Japanese season reveal a league focused on structural integrity during this transition period. Capcom has introduced a new "Player Rental" framework designed to force teams to build their own identities rather than relying on shared talent pools.

Under the new Section 2 and 3 regulations, a team’s four-player roster must contain at least three "Signed Players" (officially contracted members) or "Free Agents." Crucially, teams can now include **only one "Signed Free Agent"** per season. This category is defined as a player borrowed from another SFL organization.

Furthermore, the league is clamping down on "feeder" behaviors. A new condition stipulates that a team cannot loan out its players if it hasn't already secured a full roster of four signed players for itself. The intent is clear. Teams must prioritize their own house before helping a rival.

## Uniform Standardization & 2027 Roadmap

The new rulebook also standardizes on-stage aesthetics. This is likely in preparation for the global integration coming with the Pro-Asia expansion. All four registered players on a team must wear uniforms with the same base design.

Specific clauses now dictate sponsor logic for borrowed players:
* **Signed Free Agents:** Cannot display their *original* team's logo on the jersey.
* **Free Agents:** Permitted to display their original team's logo (if that team is not in the SFL).

These uniform rules are effective immediately for Japan. They will serve as a "transition period" for the US and European leagues in 2026 and become mandatory globally by 2027.

## Age Limit: Domestic vs. International

The reduction of the minimum age from 18 to 15, which was highlighted during the Pro-Asia reveal, has been clarified in the official text. The new 15-year-old minimum applies specifically to **"JP League Domestic Players."**

International players looking to compete in Japan ("JP League International Players") do not automatically qualify under this rule. They must still meet the age of majority in their country of residence. This distinction ensures the league remains compliant with varying international labor and travel laws while still opening the floodgates for local Japanese prodigies.

## Preparing for Expansion

These regulation updates signal a maturing competitive ecosystem. By enforcing stricter loan caps and uniform codes, Capcom is aligning the Japanese league with traditional sports standards ahead of the massive 2027 expansion. As the league opens its doors to younger talent, these structural guardrails will ensure the competition remains stable and professional.
