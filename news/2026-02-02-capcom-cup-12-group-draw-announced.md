## Defining the "World's Strongest"

The road to the season finale at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo takes a major step forward with this broadcast. On **Sunday, February 15**, Capcom will determine the pools for the main event and the opening schedule for the team-based World Championship. This "lottery" is notorious for creating high-tension "Groups of Death" by placing multiple tournament favorites into the same pool.

With the roster nearly finalized, players like **MenaRD** and **Punk** will be watching closely to see if they are placed in a balanced group or forced to eliminate fellow contenders early in the tournament. The field currently stands at 47 players, with the final spot in the 48-person bracket to be determined next week.

## The Clash of Super Teams

While individual glory is on the line for Capcom Cup, the stream will also settle the schedule for the *Street Fighter League World Championship*. The format for the World Championship is confirmed as a **Double Round-Robin** group stage, where the three regional champion teams will face off twice. The top two teams will advance to the Grand Finals.

The draw on February 15 will determine the specific match order (Home vs Away) for these sets. This schedule is critical, as the "Home" team in SFL typically has the advantage of counter-picking characters after the "Away" team declares their lineup. The regional titans from the US, Europe, and Japan will be vying for every advantage in this three-team showdown.
