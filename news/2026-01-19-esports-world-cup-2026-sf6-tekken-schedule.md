## The Road to Riyadh 2026

The Esports World Cup Foundation (EWCF) announced that the 2026 edition of the event will run from **July 6 to August 23**. The Fighting Game Community remains a cornerstone of the festival, with *Street Fighter 6* and *Tekken 8* positioned as marquee events in the middle of the eight-week schedule.

The financial stakes have reached new heights with a $75 million total purse, a $5 million increase over the 2025 iteration. For fighting game competitors, the individual game championships are expected to maintain their lucrative $1 million prize pools, but the real pressure lies in the $30 million Club Championship. This team-based metric forces organizations to secure consistent high placements, making multi-game specialists and consistent bracket runners more valuable than ever.

> **"The life-changing prize pool exists to support the people at the heart of esports: the players and the Clubs that invest in them year after year. EWC crowns the ultimate cross-game Club Champion."**
> — *Ralf Reichert, CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation*

## A Summer of Sequels

For *Street Fighter 6*, all eyes will be on **Xiaohai**. The Chinese legend secured the 2025 trophy in a dramatic 5-4 grand final set against **Blaz**, cementing his legacy as one of the most versatile players in history. With the tournament scheduled for **July 28–31**, players will have ample time to adjust to any mid-year balance patches before flying to Saudi Arabia.

Shortly after, *Tekken 8* will take over the venue from **August 3–9**. **Ulsan**, who dominated the 2025 bracket to claim the title, returns as the man to beat. The schedule spacing allows for maximum viewership overlap, ensuring that the FGC audience can tune in for back-to-back weeks of high-level competition without fatigue.

SNK's *Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves* is also confirmed to return, kicking off the festivities in early July.
