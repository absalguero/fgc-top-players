The **Street Fighter League (SFL) Pro-US 2025** season has crowned its champion. In a clash between the season's most dominant force and the defending league champions, **Bandits** defeated **FlyQuest** in the Grand Finals to secure the title and their invitation to the World Championship.

While the playoffs featured a strong lower-bracket run from FlyQuest, the final result ultimately reflected the story of the entire season: Bandits sitting untouchable at the top.

## The Unstoppable Force
Entering the playoffs as the number one seed, Bandits enjoyed a significant advantage. By finishing the regular season with a commanding **11-1 record**, they bypassed the elimination matches that defined the early hours of the broadcast. As detailed in our [regular season recap](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/bandits-dominates-sfl-us-regular-season-playoff-bracket-set/), the squad led by **MenaRD**, **Caba**, **Chris T**, and **Booce** has operated with military precision all year.

Their position in the Grand Finals allowed them to watch from the sidelines as the other three playoff teams exhausted their strategies against one another. When it came time to play, Bandits looked fresh and prepared.

## FlyQuest's Gauntlet Run
The narrative entering Sunday was focused on whether **FlyQuest** could repeat their championship success from the previous season. Despite a rocky regular season that saw them scrape into the playoffs as the fourth seed, the defending champs proved they still possessed a championship pedigree.

FlyQuest faced a daunting road, needing to win two back-to-back matches just to reach the Grand Finals.

**Round 1: FlyQuest vs. KuaiShou Gaming**
The day began with FlyQuest facing the third seed, **KuaiShou Gaming** (KSG). As we noted in our [mid-season analysis](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/sfl-us-resumes-the-final-sprint-to-the-playoffs/), KSG had found their form late in the season. However, FlyQuest's roster of **Punk**, **Nephew**, **Psycho**, and **Riddles** managed to stifle the Chinese powerhouse, eliminating them to advance.

**Semifinals: FlyQuest vs. 2Game Esports**
The challenge escalated in the semifinals against the second seed, **2Game Esports**. The South American coalition had been the breakout team of the season. In a tense set, FlyQuest's experience in high-pressure elimination scenarios shone through. They defeated the second seed, setting the stage for a showdown between the league's past and present kings.

## The Grand Final Shutdown
The Grand Finals set the stage for a dramatic conclusion: the defending champions (FlyQuest) aiming to complete a bracket run against the regular-season juggernauts (Bandits).

However, Bandits had no intention of letting the title slip away. The match was a comprehensive shutdown of FlyQuest's momentum. Bandits utilized their preparation advantage perfectly, dismantling the strategies that had carried FlyQuest through the previous two rounds. **MenaRD** and his team controlled the pace of the match from the outset, winning the set handily to close out the season.

## The World Championship Stage
With this victory, **Bandits** has officially punched their ticket to the **Street Fighter League World Championship**. They will represent the US region against the top teams from around the globe.

They join a dangerous field of contenders, including the reigning European champions. As reported earlier, [Ninjas in Pyjamas defeated MOUZ](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/ninjas-in-pyjamas-upset-mouz-to-claim-sfl-pro-europe-2025-title/) to claim back-to-back SFL Pro-Europe titles. The clash between MenaRD's Bandits and the European representatives promises to be a highlight of the upcoming World Championship.
