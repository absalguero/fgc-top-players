## End of an Era for ZETA DIVISION

The *Street Fighter* community bid a somber farewell to one of its brightest stars today as **Kakeru** officially announced his departure from **ZETA DIVISION**. The move comes two months after the Japanese ace revealed he would be retiring from professional esports due to serious [health concerns](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/kakeru's-health-struggles-keep-him-out-of-competition/).

While the separation was expected (Kakeru had previously stated he would leave the team by the end of the year), the official announcement marks the final chapter of his tenure with the powerhouse organization. During his time with ZETA, Kakeru cemented himself as a global threat, known for his mechanical precision and mastery of JP. This skill led him to victory at the Esports World Cup (Gamers8) and eventually the world championship at **Capcom Cup 11**, succeeding the inaugural champion, UMA.

> **"I will leave ZETA DIVISION... and will focus solely on recovering my health going forward. The time I spent dedicating myself to esports as a competitor... is an irreplaceable treasure to me."**
> — *Kakeru (via earlier statement)*
