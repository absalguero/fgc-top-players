## The Ultimate Showdown in Yokohama

After months of league play and a high-stakes playoff bracket, the final two teams are locked in. **Crazy Raccoon** dominated Division S with a roster featuring Shuto and Bonchan. They will face **REJECT** from Division F, led by the legendary Tokido and Leshar.

The Grand Final takes place at the **Pacifico Yokohama**. Tickets for the venue sold out almost immediately, guaranteeing an electric atmosphere for the domestic title match. The winning team will not only claim the Japanese crown but also earn the right to represent the region on the global stage. They will join **BANDITS** (US) and **Ninjas in Pyjamas** (Europe) at the upcoming World Championship in March.

This matchup is widely considered a "dream battle" by analysts. Both organizations boast rosters filled with Evo champions and Capcom Cup veterans. The extended format of the Grand Final will test each team's depth and character mastery.

* **1st Place:** 9,000,000 JPY + World Championship Spot
* **2nd Place:** 4,000,000 JPY
