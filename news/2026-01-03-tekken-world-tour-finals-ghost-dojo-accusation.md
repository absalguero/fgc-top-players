**The Tekken World Tour (TWT)** has stumbled into controversy yet again as serious allegations of bracket manipulation have surfaced just weeks before the Global Finals.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Major Accusation:** Tournament organizer Raef is accused of using bot accounts to artificially inflate "Dojo" event numbers to 96+ entrants.
* **Recurring Issue:** This follows a previous incident where Bandai Namco banned MEA3 organizers for collusion, establishing a concerning pattern of regional misconduct.
* **Systemic Flaw:** Critics argue that the decentralized "Dojo" system lacks the necessary oversight to prevent bad actors from gaming the leaderboard.

## A Black Eye for the World Tour Finals

As the community prepares for the Tekken World Tour Finals at the end of the month, a detailed accusation by community member Blckpanther has cast a shadow over the event's integrity. The allegations target Raef, a tournament organizer, claiming that his "Jeddah Dojo" events utilized fake entrant data to exploit the TWT point system.

The core of the issue lies in the "Dojo" tiering system, where a tournament must reach 96 entrants to award the maximum 150 global points. Blckpanther’s investigation alleges that Raef’s events were populated by accounts with "identical, AI-like naming patterns" created simultaneously to hit this exact threshold.

> **"If nothing is done about this blatant cheating, it will eliminate ALL integrity from the Tekken World Tour. An average person looking at this would know it is blatant cheating."**

This is not an isolated incident. It marks another in a series of allegations regarding the gaming of the system, following the [permanent ban of MEA3 organizers](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/bandai-namco-permanently-bans-mea3-organizers-revokes-dojo-points-over-collusion/) for similar collusion tactics earlier in the season. The recurrence of these issues suggests a fundamental loophole in how regional points are verified.

## Details & Additional Information

The evidence provided highlights statistical anomalies that are difficult to ignore. The "Jeddah Dojo 4" reportedly had a fully populated 96-player bracket yet recorded zero disqualifications. This is a rarity in large-scale open tournaments where "no-shows" are common. Furthermore, the accusation notes that these same naming patterns appeared in a separate Dojo event two weeks prior.

This situation puts a spotlight on the vulnerability of the TWT's decentralized qualification model. While intended to foster local communities, the reliance on the honor system has seemingly allowed bad actors to manufacture "Ghost Dojos." With hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, this sort of cheating will likely continue until Bandai Namco takes decisive action to secure the process.

## What’s Next

With the TWT Finals fast approaching at the end of the month, the timeline for a comprehensive investigation that would alter the current roster is tight. Instead, the focus for many is on the future and the steps Bandai Namco must take to address these verification loopholes.

Ensuring these issues are resolved is critical to keeping the integrity of the tournament circuit intact for the next season. For now, the concern is not necessarily that the eventual champion will be illegitimate, but rather whether the most deserving players were actually invited to the event in the first place.
