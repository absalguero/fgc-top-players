Going undefeated in the high-pressure environment of the **Street Fighter League (SFL)** is a rare feat. Yet as the **Street Fighter League Pro-Europe 2025** league play concludes, **EndingWalker** has done exactly that. The **MOUZ** anchor finished the group stage with a flawless **10-0** individual record. This performance secured his team the number one seed and a direct path to the Grand Finals.

## The Perfect Anchor

EndingWalker's performance was the driving force behind MOUZ's success. By winning every single match he played, he generated **180 points** for his team. This accounted for more than half of their total score. This reliability allowed his teammates **Problem X**, **Lexx**, and **Garnet** to play with freedom, knowing their anchor would close out the set.

EndingWalker utilized **Ryu** throughout the league to dismantle the competition. He secured critical victories over veteran players like **AngryBird** (Ninjas in Pyjamas) and **ImStillDaDaddy**. These wins proved decisive in keeping MOUZ at the top of the leaderboard.

## Championship Stakes

By finishing first, MOUZ skips the playoff bracket. They now sit in the Grand Final, scheduled for **Saturday, November 29**, where they will await the winner of the playoff gauntlet.

The stakes for this final match are massive. The winner of SFL Europe 2025 will earn a spot at the **Street Fighter League World Championship**. There they will represent the region against the champions from **SFL US** and **SFL Japan** for the title of best team in the world. With EndingWalker in this form, MOUZ is in a strong position to qualify for the global stage.
