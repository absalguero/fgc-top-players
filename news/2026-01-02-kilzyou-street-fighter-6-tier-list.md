**Kilzyou** has **unveiled his 2026 tier list**, presenting a meta snapshot that crowns **Ed** and **Ryu** as the current kings of *Street Fighter 6* while casting doubt on the viability of former top tiers like Chun-Li.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Data Alignment:** Kilzyou’s placement of Ed and Ryu at the top of S-Tier perfectly matches our current [tournament data](https://fgctopplayers.com/tier-list/), where they hold the #1 and #2 spots respectively.
* **The Chun-Li Divergence:** While tournament data ranks Chun-Li as a strong A-Tier contender, Kilzyou rates her as a C-Tier character, suggesting a massive gap between her theoretical strength and his competitive assessment.
* **DLC Hype:** Kilzyou is bullish on Terry and Sagat (S-Tier), despite tournament data currently placing them in B and D tiers respectively.

## Ed and Ryu: Validated by the Stats

French phenom Kilyan "Kilzyou" Faucheux has released his first comprehensive tier list of the year. The most striking takeaway is the validation of the current competitive leaderboard: Kilzyou places **Ed** and **Ryu** at the very forefront of his **S-Tier**.

This assessment is not just an opinion, it is backed by cold, hard numbers. According to our latest **tournament data**, Ed is currently the undisputed #1 character in the world with a Competitive Performance Viability (CPV) of **99.99**, followed immediately by Ryu at #2 (71.81). While the S-Tier is crowded with eight characters including **Mai** and **Blanka**, Kilzyou’s decision to lead with Ed and Ryu confirms that the pro perception aligns with the statistical reality of their dominance.

## Data Analysis: Kilzyou vs. The Stats

While the top of the list shows harmony between player opinion and tournament results, the rest of Kilzyou's rankings reveal significant disagreements with the global data.

**The Chun-Li & Zangief Disconnect**
The most controversial aspect of the list is the placement of **Chun-Li** and **Zangief** in **C-Tier (Weak)**.
* **Kilzyou's Take:** Ranks them as low-tier struggles, alongside Jamie and Lily.
* **The Data:** Strongly disagrees. Tournament results place **Chun-Li** in **A-Tier** (Rank 10) and **Zangief** in **A-Tier** (Rank 9).
This suggests that while Kilzyou feels these characters are weak in the current meta, the global player base is still finding consistent success with them in bracket.

**Ken: Mid or Top?**
Kilzyou places **Ken** in **B-Tier**, signaling that the former king of SF6 has fallen off. However, the data shows Ken holding steady in **A-Tier** (Rank 7), suggesting he remains a more potent threat in actual tournament play than Kilzyou gives him credit for.

**The "New Toy" Syndrome?**
Kilzyou is incredibly optimistic about the DLC characters. He places **Terry Bogard** and **Sagat** in **S-Tier**.
* **The Data:** Currently paints a different picture, ranking **Terry** in **B-Tier** and **Sagat** down in **D-Tier**.
This discrepancy is due to the "lag" in tournament results. Sagat is a newer addition, and his low data CPV (5.93) reflects a lack of representation rather than a lack of power.

## What’s Next

The validity of these rankings will be tested immediately as the 2026 competitive circuit kicks off. Major events like **Frosty Faustings XVIII** (Jan 29) and the **Street Fighter League World Championship** in March will provide the first real battlegrounds to see if Kilzyou's low opinion of Chun-Li and high praise for Sagat holds up in high-stakes play.
