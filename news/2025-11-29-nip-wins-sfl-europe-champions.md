**Ninjas in Pyjamas (NIP)** have been crowned the **Street Fighter League (SFL) Pro-Europe 2025 Champions**. In a Grand Final that defied the regular season odds, the third-seeded squad defeated **MOUZ** to claim the regional title and the €60,000 grand prize.

## Grand Final Recap: NIP vs. MOUZ
The ultimate match-up pitted the two top teams of the playoffs against one another. **MOUZ** entered the Grand Finals as the 1st seed after finishing the regular season with a 9-1 record and a perfect run from their anchor, EndingWalker. By finishing first, they earned a direct ticket to the Grand Final where they awaited the survivor of the playoff gauntlet.

**Ninjas in Pyjamas** entered the playoffs as the 3rd seed. The squad, featuring **Phenom**, **AngryBird**, **Big Bird**, and **JuicyJoe**, had to battle through the lower bracket. They defeated the 2nd seed, **Aegis**, in the semi-finals before advancing to face MOUZ.

In the Grand Final, NIP displayed incredible determination. Despite the statistical advantage held by MOUZ, the NIP roster adapted to the matchup effectively. They won the ultimate face-off and extinguished the hopes MOUZ held for a "perfect season" at the final hurdle.

With this victory, Ninjas in Pyjamas secures the sole European spot at the **Street Fighter League World Championship**, where they will face the champions of SFL US and SFL Japan.
