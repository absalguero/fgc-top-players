The **15th TOPANGA Charity Cup** has reached a historic milestone with **1,231 teams** and **6,157 players** registered to compete in the massive 5v5 Street Fighter 6 tournament.

**Key Takeaways:**
* **Massive Scale:** The field has shattered previous records, featuring over 1,200 teams in a single-elimination "Kachinuki" (winner-stays-on) bracket.
* **Charity Partnership:** 100% of proceeds and donations will be sent to the Japanese Red Cross Society, specifically aiding ongoing recovery efforts for the Noto Peninsula earthquake victims.
* **Pro Participation:** The event features legendary figures including Daigo Umehara and major pro squads from Reject, Varrel, and Crazy Raccoon.

## The FGC Unites for Noto Peninsula Recovery
The **15th TOPANGA Charity Cup** is scheduled to begin its broadcast on December 20 at 11:00 AM JST. As one of the most significant dates in the FGC calendar, this online event serves as a platform for the community to provide aid through their passion for fighting games. This year, the focus remains on the Japanese Red Cross Society and the long-term reconstruction efforts following the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

The tournament utilizes the "Kachinuki" format, a staple of Japanese team competition. In this style, the winner of a match stays on to face the next member of the opposing team. This often results in high-drama "anchoring" performances where one player must defeat multiple opponents to secure a team victory.

## How to Watch
Due to the unprecedented number of entrants, the tournament will be broadcast across multiple official channels to capture as much of the bracket action as possible.
