## Reuniting with Friends

HotDog29 (Yeh Man Ho) announced the move on social media, revealing his new jersey and handle: **Yesports | KatsuGear | HotDog29**. This marks a significant shift for the player following his departure from Talon Esports in October 2025.

In his announcement, HotDog29 emphasized the personal significance of the roster move. By joining Yesports, he is reuniting with close peers in the scene, a factor he noted has renewed his drive to compete.

He joins a formidable lineup of regional talent:
* **HumanBomb** (Cheng Jonny-lai): A legendary Hong Kong fighting game veteran and long-time Yesports representative.
* **Rainpro** (Chiu Chin-yat): The rising star who joined the organization in December 2024.
* **RB** (Kao Fu-pin): The Taiwanese veteran who signed with Yesports in mid-2025.

The move consolidates some of the strongest talent in the Asia East region under one banner. Yesports has long positioned itself as a hub for Hong Kong esports development. Securing HotDog29, consistently one of the strongest competitors in the region, reinforces that mission.

The move provides him with essential organizational support just in time for the conclusion of the Capcom Pro Tour 2025 season. HotDog29 secured his spot at **Capcom Cup 12** in November by winning the CPT 2025 World Warrior: Asia East Regional Final. It was a dramatic run. After falling to **Oil King** 0-3 in Winners Finals, HotDog29 rallied in Grand Finals to reset the bracket 3-0, ultimately sealing the tournament with a 3-1 victory in the final set.

## What’s Next

With the sponsorship question resolved, the focus shifts entirely to gameplay. HotDog29 is one of the premier M. Bison players in the world, and his performance at the upcoming **Capcom Cup 12** will be a litmus test for his new chapter with Yesports. Fans can expect to see him debuting the new colors on the global stage very soon.
