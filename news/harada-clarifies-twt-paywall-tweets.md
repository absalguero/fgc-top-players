Following our [previous report](/news/tekken-producer-harada-addresses-esports-revenue-gap-and-capcom-paywall/) regarding Katsuhiro Harada's comments on the financial gap in fighting game esports, the *Tekken* executive producer has taken to social media to calm the rising tide of speculation. In a series of tweets, Harada clarified that despite his interest in industry data, Bandai Namco has no current intention of putting the *Tekken World Tour (TWT)* behind a paywall.

The clarification comes as a relief to a community already on edge following Capcom's controversial decision to charge for the *Capcom Cup 12* finals.

## Clearing the Air

Harada's initial comments, which expressed interest in the "pay-per-view" models being tested by competitors, were interpreted by many, including major media outlets, as a signal that *Tekken* might be next. Harada refuted this interpretation. He stated directly that he "never explicitly stated" a desire to make streaming paid.

He emphasized that his role requires him to analyze all business models within the industry, but observation does not equal implementation. Harada expressed frustration with how his musings on the industry's economic structure were aggregated into a confirmation of future policy. He reiterated that, for the time being, *Tekken* streaming remaining free is the status quo.

## The Promotional Expense Model

The confusion stemmed from the distinction between Harada as a *business executive* and Harada as a *game producer*. In his follow-up, he explained that the *Tekken World Tour* has historically operated outside of Bandai Namco’s core business scope regarding direct revenue generation.

He explicitly stated that TWT is treated as a "promotional expense" rather than a profit seeking product. This structure remains unchanged. While he remains "interested" in how Capcom's experiment will shift these economics, he clarified that this curiosity is academic rather than a roadmap for *Tekken 8*.

## The "At the Moment" Caveat

While the immediate threat of a paywall has been dismissed, the conversation around esports sustainability is likely far from over. Harada’s denial was firm regarding current plans, but the industry is in a volatile state.

With development costs for fighting games skyrocketing, and *Tekken 8* being the most expensive entry in the series history, publishers are inevitably looking for ways to justify their esports investments. For now, fans can rest easy knowing the *Tekken World Tour* finals will remain accessible to all. However, the community will likely keep a watchful eye on how the market reacts to Capcom's upcoming pay-per-view experiment. Its success or failure could still dictate the future policies of Bandai Namco and others in the years to come.
