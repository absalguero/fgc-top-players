## The Road to the Grand Finals

The Street Fighter League (SFL) Pro-JP 2025 Playoffs concluded this weekend with high-stakes matches across both divisions. The format saw the top teams from the regular season battling for a chance to advance to the season's Grand Finals.

In **Division S**, held on December 13, **Crazy Raccoon (CR)** proved why they are a force to be reckoned with. Although they did not hold the top seed, they showcased championship caliber play. After a tense 20-20 draw in the first set against Good 8 Squad (G8S), CR shifted gears. The roster of Dogura, Bonchan, Kazunoko, and Shuto delivered a masterclass in the second set, sweeping G8S 40-0. With the aggregate score at 60-20, CR needed 10 more points to reach the 70-point victory threshold. They sealed the deal with a victory in the tiebreaker set (Dogura vs. Kawano), finishing 70-20. Earlier in the bracket, Crazy Raccoon had to overcome Nagoya OJA to reach the division final.

**Division F** action followed on December 14, where **REJECT (RC)** emerged victorious. Their opponent, Team iXA, had just completed a victory against ZETA DIVISION in the semifinals (defeating them 40-0 in the decider). However, REJECT's star-studded lineup, featuring legends like Tokido, Daigo Umehara, and the explosive Leshar, proved too much. Similar to the other division, the first set ended in a 20-20 draw. REJECT then took control, winning the subsequent set 40-0 and closing out the match in the tiebreaker to secure their place in the Grand Finals.

## Detailed Playoff Scores

The playoffs utilized a multi-set format where teams earned points for individual match wins. A "Home" and "Away" system dictated the character selection process. The Away team must reveal their order first, allowing the Home team to counter-pick matchups.

The most shocking result of the weekend was the sheer dominance displayed in the second sets of both Division Finals. Both Crazy Raccoon and REJECT managed to shut out their opponents in these pivotal sets, denying Good 8 Squad and Team iXA any momentum before closing out the series in the tiebreakers.
