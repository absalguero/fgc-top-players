The fighting game community (FGC) calendar is seeing a major reshuffle for 2026. **Community Effort Orlando (CEO)**, one of the most prestigious fighting game tournaments in the world, has officially set its dates for **August 14-16, 2026**. This marks a significant departure from the event's traditional late-June timeframe, a move directly influenced by the shifting sands of the global FGC schedule.

## The "Evo Effect": Why CEO Moved to August

For over a decade, the "Summer of Fighting Games" has typically kicked off with CEO in June. However, that rhythm is set to reverse in 2026.

The catalyst for this change is **Evo 2026**, which announced it is moving its Las Vegas event to **June 26-28, 2026** (dates that historically belonged to CEO). Rather than forcing players to choose between two major events in the same month, CEO organizer **Alex Jebailey** and Evo General Manager Rick "The Hadou" Thiher coordinated the shift to ensure both tournaments could thrive.

## A More Balanced Competitive Calendar

The move to August 14-16 effectively extends the major tournament season, creating a more balanced rhythm for the community.

The new schedule establishes a distinct timeline for the North American major circuit. With **Combo Breaker** traditionally held in late May, **Evo** now occupying late June, and **CEO** shifting to mid-August, the calendar is significantly less congested. This increased spacing reduces the financial and travel strain of back-to-back weekends, making it much more feasible for competitors to attend all three "pillars" of the North American fighting game community.

## The Grand Finale of the Summer

Moving to mid-August positions CEO as the grand finale of the summer season.

This new placement provides a valuable narrative buffer after Evo. In previous years, the proximity of the events often meant players were rushing from one to the next. Now, the storylines, rivalries, and champion arcs established in Las Vegas will have time to develop before players look to settle the score in Orlando.

By pushing the date back, organizers are also giving attendees more time to plan and save for their trip to Florida, ensuring that the "CEO experience" remains a highlight of the year.

## A Unique Event Experience

Since its inception in 2010, CEO has grown from a local gathering into a global destination. CEO is best known for its deep integration of **pro wrestling culture**. Unlike standard esports stage setups, CEO features a genuine wrestling ring where Top 8 finalists compete. The tournament is famous for its player entrances, allowing competitors to walk down the ramp to their own theme music, often accompanied by costumes and theatrics.
