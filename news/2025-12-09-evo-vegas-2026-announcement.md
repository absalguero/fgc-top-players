The road to the next Evolution Championship Series has officially begun, and the landscape of the FGC is shifting dramatically. In a historic broadcast, the Evo 2026 Announcement Show revealed a massive restructuring of the global circuit. From a major calendar shift for Las Vegas to a record-breaking expansion for Tokyo, here is the in-depth breakdown of everything coming to Evo in 2026.

## Evo Vegas 2026: New Dates, "Player-Choice" Finals, and $500k Prizing

The biggest headline for the American event is the date. For the first time in years, **Evo Vegas 2026** is moving away from its traditional August window to avoid the blistering Las Vegas late-summer heat. The event will now take place from **June 26 – June 28, 2026**, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hall. This move has already impacted the broader esports calendar, with [CEO 2026 setting August dates](https://fgctopplayers.com/news/ceo-2026-sets-august-dates-following-evo-schedule-shake-up/) to balance the summer season.

### The Unified 12-Game Lineup
Evo Vegas is abolishing the distinction between "main" and "side" tournaments. There will be **12 Official Evo Games**, all featuring medal support and a share of the increased **$500,000 minimum guaranteed prize pool**.

1.  **Street Fighter 6**
2.  **Tekken 8**
3.  **Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves**
4.  **Guilty Gear -Strive-**
5.  **Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising**
6.  **Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes**
7.  **Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O.**
8.  **2XKO** (Riot Games' League of Legends fighter)
9.  **Rivals of Aether 2**
10. **BlazBlue: Central Fiction**
11. **Vampire Savior** (Darkstalkers 3)
12. **Invincible Versus** (World Premiere Title)

### "You Decide the Arena"
In a revolutionary format change, the Evo team will not hand-pick the Sunday Arena finalists. **The six games with the highest registration numbers will automatically advance to the Arena stage.** This democratic approach allows community passion to dictate the main stage. If a legacy title like *Vampire Savior* out-registers a modern release, it earns the prime-time slot. The remaining six titles will conclude on the upgraded **Showcase Stage**, which features its own spectacle, including gold-plated arcade sticks for the champions.

Additional Vegas upgrades include:
* **Pricing:** Early bird passes are under $200 (fees included).
* **Format:** More "Best of 5" Top 8s for games like *Tekken 8* and *Fatal Fury*.
* **Museums:** The return of the Evo Art Museum, Stick Museum, and the *Moment 37* Experience.

## Evo Japan 2026: Golden Week Expansion

Evo Japan is returning to **Tokyo Big Sight** during Golden Week, running from **May 1 – May 3, 2026**. Organizers are promising the largest Evo Japan in history with a **30 Million Yen** prize pool and significant infrastructure improvements, including upgraded air conditioning and a "patched" seating arrangement to handle the crowds.

### A Unique 12-Game Roster
Like its Vegas counterpart, Evo Japan will feature 12 official tournaments. The lineup includes global staples alongside regional exclusives that highlight Japan's arcade heritage:
* **Hokuto no Ken** (Fist of the North Star) – The legendary competitive "kusoge" finally hits the main stage.
* **Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage**
* **Vampire Savior**
* **Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves** (First Evo Japan champion to be crowned)
* **2XKO** (First Evo Japan champion to be crowned)

### New Exhibits and Cosplay
Evo Japan is expanding its floor activities with the debut of the **Evo Fighting Collectible Exhibit**. Partnering with AmiAmi and Kotobukiya, this exhibit will feature rare statues, figures, and toys.

The Cosplay Contest is also receiving a massive buff. The winner will receive a **free trip to any Evo event of their choice**, incentivizing the world's best crafters to bring their best work to Tokyo.

## The Evo Awards Return

The **Evo Awards**, powered by Qiddiya, are back for 2026 with a revamped nomination process. Unlike previous years where fans only voted on the winners, the community now decides the finalists.

Fans can submit nominations for a wide range of categories, including:
* **Competitive:** Match of the Year, Comeback of the Year, Best Combo, Best Pop-Off.
* **Community:** Content Creator of the Year, Commentator of the Year, Best Local.
* **Creative:** Best Cosplay, Best Dressed, Best Custom Controller, Best Fan Artist.
* **Fun:** Best Meme, "The Next" (Breakout Player).

The ceremony will also feature new inductees into the Evo Hall of Fame.

Registration for both Evo Vegas 2026 and Evo Japan 2026 is open now at [evo.gg](https://www.evo.gg).
