Riot Games has officially confirmed the console release window and esports roadmap for their upcoming tag-team fighter. In a developer update released this week, the *2XKO* team announced that the game will launch on consoles in January 2026 and introduced the 2026 Competitive Series, a global circuit that integrates directly with existing community tournaments.

## The 2026 Competitive Series
Unlike the franchised leagues seen in *League of Legends* or *VALORANT*, the **2XKO 2026 Competitive Series** will operate through partnerships with established Fighting Game Community (FGC) events. For the 2026 season, Riot will sanction and support 20 global tournaments. These are divided into two distinct tiers tied to the game's five in-game seasons:

* **Majors (5 Events):** There will be one Major per season. These serve as the primary competitive milestones for the year.
* **Challengers (15 Events):** Geared toward regional competition, there will be three Challenger events per season to provide wider access to the circuit.

Riot stated that their goal is to offer direct monetary support, promotion, and prize pool contributions to these community organizers rather than creating a separate, developer-run league.

## Initial Tournament Schedule
The developer revealed the first set of events for the 2026 season. The competitive year will begin with **Frosty Faustings** in Lombard, Illinois, which will serve as the first Major from January 29 to February 1, 2026.

Following the kickoff Major, the circuit will continue with three Challenger events in February and March:
* **Genesis** (San Jose, CA)
* **Texas Showdown** (Houston, TX)
* **Viennality** (Vienna, Austria)

## Crowdfunded Support and Mechanics
To ensure sustainability for tournament organizers, Riot introduced the **"Frame Perfect" skin line**. A portion of the proceeds from these competitive-themed skins will go directly toward funding prize pools and covering production costs for the sanctioned events.

Additionally, the team clarified the rules for the **Duo Bounty** system. At Frosty Faustings, the cash bonus for duo teams will be awarded to the highest-placing duo regardless of their final standing, removing the previous requirement that a duo team must win the entire tournament to claim the bounty.

## Console Launch Details
While PC players have had access to Alpha tests, console players now have a confirmed release window. *2XKO* will launch on **PlayStation 5** and **Xbox Series X|S** in **January 2026**. Players can currently add the title to their wishlists on both the PlayStation and Xbox digital stores.
